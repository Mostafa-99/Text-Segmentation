book the first recalled to life




i the period


it was the best of times
it was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom
it was the age of foolishness
it was the epoch of belief
it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of light
it was the season of darkness
it was the spring of hope
it was the winter of despair
we had everything before us
we had nothing before us
we were all going direct to heaven
we were all going direct the other way
in short the period was so far like the present period that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for
evil in the superlative degree of comparison only

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face on the
throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face on the throne of france in both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes
that things in general were settled forever

it was the year of our lord one thousands even hundred and seventy five
spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period
as at this mrs southcott had recently attained her five and twentieth
blessed birthday of whom a prophetic private in the lifeguards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of london and westminster even the cock lane
ghost had been laid only around dozen of years after rapping out its
messages as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally
deficient in originality rapped out theirs mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people
from a congress of british subjects in america which strange
to relate have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cock lane
brood

france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill making paper money and spending it under the guidance of her
christian pastors she entertained herself besides with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cutoff his tongue
torn out with pincers and his body burned alive because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of france and
norway there were growing trees when that sufferer was put to death
already marked by the woodman fate to come down and be sawn into
boards to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it terrible in history it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris there were
sheltered from the weather that very day rude carts be spattered with
rustic mire snuffed about by pigs and roost ed in by poultry which
the farmer death had already set apart to be his tum bril s of
the revolution but that woodman and that farmer though they work
unceasingly work silently and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistic al and traitorous

in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting daring burglaries by armed men and
highway robberies took place in the capital itself everynight
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers warehouses for security the highwayman
in the dark was a city tradesman in the light and being recognised and
challenged by his fellow tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
the captain gallantly shot him through the head and rode away the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers and the guards hot three dead and
then got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in peace
that magnificent potentate the lord mayor of london was made to stand
and deliver on turnham green by one highwayman who despoiled the
illustrious creature insight of all his retinue prisoners in london
gaols fought battles with their turn keys and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbuss es in among them loaded with rounds of shot and ball
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
court drawing rooms musketeers went into stg i less to search
for contraband goods and the mob fired on the musketeers and the
musketeers fired on the mob and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way in the midst of them the hangman ever busy
and ever worse than useless was in constant requisition now stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals now hanging a house breaker on
saturday who had been taken on tuesday now burning people in the
hand at newgate by the dozen and now burning pamphlets at the door of
westminster hall today taking the life of an atrocious murderer
and tomorrow of a wretched pilfer er who had robbed a farmers boy of
sixpence

all these things and a thousand like them came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousands even hundred and seventy five
environ ed by them while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded
those two of the large jaws and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces trod with stir enough and carried their divine rights
with a high hand thus did the year one thousands even hundred
and seventy five conduct their greatness es and myriads of small
creatures the creatures of this chronicle among the rest along the
roads that lay before them




ii the mail


it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business
the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered up
shooters hill he walked uphill in the mire by the side of the mail
as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise under the circumstances but because the hill
and the harness and the mud and the mail were all so heavy that the
horses had three times already come to as top besides once drawing the
coach across the road with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to blackheath reins and whip and coachman and guard however in
combination had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animals
are endued with reason and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way through
the thick mud floundering and stumbling between while sas if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints as often as the driver rested
them and brought them toast and with a wary wo ho soho then the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it like an
unusually emphatic horse denying that the coach could be got up the
hill whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a
nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed in its
forlorn ness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding
none a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do it was dense enough to shutout
everything from the light of the coach lamps but these its own workings
and a few yards of road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it as if they had made it all

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears and wore jackboots not one of the three could have said from
anything he saw what either of the other two was like and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind as from
the eyes of the body of his two companions in those days travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers as to the latter
when every posting house andale house could produce somebody in
the captains pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
nondescript it was the likeliest thing upon the cards so the guard
of the dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousands even hundred and seventy five lumbering up shooters hill as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail beating his feet
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse pistols
deposited on a substratum of cutlass

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers the passengers suspected one another and the guard they
all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the
journey

wo ho said the coachman so the none more pull and your eat the
top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to get you to
it joe

hallo a the guard replied

what oclock do you make it joe

ten minutes good past eleven

my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not a top of shooters
yet tst yah get on with you

the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided negative
made a decided scramble for it and the three other horses followed
suit once more the dover mail struggled on with the jackboots of its
passengers squashing along by its side they had stopped when the coach
stopped and they kept close company with it if anyone of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fairway of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman

the last burst carried the mailto the summit of the hill the horses
stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent and open the coach door to let the passengers in

tst joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down from his
box

what do you say tom

they both listened

i say a horse at a canter coming up joe

i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving his hold
of the door and mounting nimbly to his place gentlemen in the kings
name all of you

with this hurried adj uration he cocked his blunderbuss and stood on
the offensive

the passenger booked by this history was on the coach step getting in
the two other passengers were close behind him and about to follow he
remained on the step half in the coach and half out of they remained
in the road below him they all looked from the coachman to the guard
and from the guard to the coachman and listened the coachman looked
back and the guard looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his ears and looked back without contradicting

the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach added to the stillness of the night made it very quiet
indeed the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach as if it were in a state of agitation the hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard but at any rate the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath and holding
the breath and having the pulses quickened by expectation

the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill

soho the guard sang out as loud a she could roar yo there stand
i shall fire

the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering
a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail

never you mind what it is the guard retorted what are you

is that the dover mail

why do you want to know

i want a passenger if it is

what passenger

mr jarvis lorry

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name the guard
the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him distrust fully

keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist
because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right in
your lifetime gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight

what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly quavering
speech who wants me is it jerry

i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard to
himself hes hoarse r than suits me is jerry

yes mr lorry

what is the matter

a despatch sent after you from over yonder t and co

i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down into the
road assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach shut the door and
pulled up the window he may come close theres nothing wrong

i hope there a int but icant make so nation sure of that said the
guarding ruff soliloquy hallo you

well and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before

come on at a foot pace dye mind me and if youve got holsters to that
saddle o your n dont let me see your hand go nigh em for ima devil
at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes the form of lead so
now lets look at you

the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist
and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood the rider
stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed the passenger
a small folded paper the riders horse was blown and both horse and
rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man

guard said the passenger in at one of quiet business confidence

the watchful guard with his righthand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman
answered curtly sir

there is nothing to apprehend i belong to tell sons bank you must
know tell sons bank in london i am going to paris on business a crown
to drink i may read this

if so be as you re quick sir

he opened it in the light of the coach lamp on that side and
read first to himself and then aloud wait at dover form am selle
its not long you see guard jerry say that my answer was recalled
to life

jerry started in his saddle that sa blazing strange answer too
said he a this hoarse st

take that message back and they will know that i received this as
well as if i wrote make the best of your way goodnight

with those words the passenger opened the coach door and got in not at
all assisted by his fellow passengers who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep with no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action

the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm chest and having looked to the rest of its contents and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which there were a
few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderbox for he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach lamps had been blown
and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had only to shut
himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he were lucky in
five minutes

tom softly over the coach roof

hallo joe

did you hear the message

i did joe

what did you make of it tom

nothing at all joe

that sa coincidence too the guard m used for i made the same of it
myself

jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile not
only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his face and
shake the wet out of his hat brim which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon after standing with the bridle over his
heavily splashed arm until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again he turned to walk down the
hill

after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust your
foreleg still i get you on the level said this hoarse messenger
glancing a this mare recalled to life that sa blazing strange
message much of that wouldnt do for you jerry i say jerry you d
be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life was to come into fashion
jerry




iii the night shadows


a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other a
solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret that every
room in everyone of them encloses its own secret that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there is in some of
its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it something of the
awfulness even of death itself is referable to this no more can i
turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved and vainly hope in time
to read it all no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable
water where in as momentary lights glanced into it i have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged it was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring forever and forever when i had read
but a page it was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost when the light was playing on its surface and i stood
in ignorance on the shore my friend is dead my neighbour is dead
my love the darling of my soul is dead it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality and which i shall carry in mine to my life send in
any of the burial places of this city through which ip assist here
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their
innermost personality to me or than i am to them

as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king the
first minister of state or the richest merchant in london so with the
three passengers shutup in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach they were mysteries to one another as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six or his own coach and sixty with the
breadth of a county between him and the next

the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at
ale houses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes he had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface black with
no depth in the colour or form and much too near together as if they
were afraid of being found out in something singly if they kept too
far apart they had a sinister expression under an old cocked hat like
a three cornered spittoon and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat which descended nearly to the wearers knees when he stopped
for drink he moved this muffler with his lefthand only while he
poured his liquor in with his right as soon as that was done he
muffled again

no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as hero de
it wouldnt do for you jerry jerry you honest tradesman it wouldnt
suit your line of business recalled bust me if i dont think hed
been a drinking

his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain several
times to takeoff his hat to scratch his head except on the crown
which was ragged ly bald he had stiff black hair standing jagged lyall
over it and growing downhill almost to his broad blunt nose it was
so like smiths work so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than ahead of hair that the best of players at leapfrog might
have declined him as the most dangerous man in the world to go over

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tell sons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took such
shapes to them areas arose out of her private topics of uneasiness
they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every shadow on the road

what time the mail coach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon
its tedious way with its three fellow inscrutable s inside to whom
likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested

tell sons bank had a run upon it in the mail as the bank
passenger with an arm drawn through the leather n strap which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger
and driving him into his corner whenever the coach got a special
jolt nodded in his place with half shut eyes the little
coach windows and the coach lamp dimly gleaming through them and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger became the bank and did a great
stroke of business the rattle of the harness was the chink of money
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tell sons with
all its foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time then
the strong rooms underground at tell sons with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a
little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly burning candle and found them
safe and strong and sound and still just a she had last seen them

but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night he was on his way to dig someone
out of a grave

now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night did
not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of five and forty by
years and they differed principally in the passions they expressed
and in the ghast lines s of their worn and wasted state pride contempt
defiance stubbornness submission lamentation succeeded one another
so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous colour emaciated hands
and figures but the face was in the main one face and every head was
prematurely white a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre

buried how long

the answer was always the same almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dugout

long ago

you know that you are recalled to life

they tell me so

i hope you care to live

icant say

shall is how her to you will you come and see her

the answers to this question were various and contradictory sometimes
the broken reply was wait it would kill me if i saw her too soon
sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears and then it was
take me to her sometimes it was staring and bewildered and then it
was i dont know her i dont understand

after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig
and dig dig now with a spade now with a great key now with his
hands to dig this wretched creature out got out at last with earth
hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to dust the
passenger would then start to himself and lower the window to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek

yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the moving
patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within the real banking house by temple bar the
real business of the past day the real strong rooms the real express
sent after him and the real message returned would all be there out
of the midst of them the ghostly face would rise and he would accost
it again

buried how long

almost eighteen years

i hope you care to live

icant say

dig dig dig until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pullup the window draw his arm
securely through the leather n strap and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave

buried how long

almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dugout

long ago

the words were still in his hearing as just spoken distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that the
shadows of the night were gone

he lowered the window and looked out at the risingsun there was a
ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were un yoked beyond a quiet coppice wood
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees though the earth was cold and wet the sky was clear
and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful

eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun gracious
creator of day to be buried alive for eighteen years




iv the preparation


when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the forenoon
the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coach door as his
custom was he did it with some flourish of ceremony for a mail journey
from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon

by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated for the two others had been set down at the irrespective
roadside destinations the mildew y inside of the coach with its damp
and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its obscurity was rather
like a larger dog kennel mr lorry the passenger shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw at angle of shaggy wrapper flapping hat and
muddy legs was rather like a larger sort of dog

there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer

yessir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair the
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon sir bed
sir

i shall not goto bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber

and then breakfast sir yessir that way sir if you please
show concord gentlemans valise and hot water to concord pull off
gentlemans boots in concord you will find a fine sea coal fire sir
fetch barber to concord stir about there now for concord

the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it consequently another
drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord
and the coffee room when a gentleman of sixty formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well kept with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed along on his way to
his breakfast

the coffee room had no other occupant that forenoon than the gentleman
in brown his breakfast table was drawn before the fire and ashes at
with its light shining on him waiting for the meal he sat so still
that he might have been sitting for his portrait

very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire he had a good leg and was a little vain
of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were of a
fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were trim he
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very close to his
head which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass
his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea a
face habitually suppressed and quieted was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner in years gone by some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of tell sons bank he had a healthy colour in his
cheeks and his face though lined bore few traces of anxiety
but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tell sons bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people and perhaps
secondhand cares like secondhand clothes come easily off and on

completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait
mr lorry dropped off to sleep the arrival of his breakfast roused him
and he said to the drawer a she moved his chair to it

i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time today she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only ask for a
gentleman from tell sons bank please to let me know

yessir tell sons bank in london sir

yes

yessir we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris sir a
vast deal of travelling sir in tells on and companys house

yes we are quite a french house as well as an english one

yessir not much in the habit of such travelling yourself i think
sir

not of late years it is fifteen years since we since i came last
from france

indeed sir that was before my time here sir before our peoples
time here sir the george was in other hands at that time sir

i believe so

but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tells on and
company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen
years ago

you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far from
the truth

indeed sir

rounding his mouth and both his eyes a she stepped backward from the
table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left
dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest while
heat e and drank as from an observatory or watchtower according to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages

when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll on
the beach the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself away
from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a marine
ostrich the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stone stumbling
wildly about and these a did what it liked and what it liked was
destruction it thundered at the town and thundered at the cliffs and
brought the coast down madly the air among the houses was of so strong
apis ca tory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it as sick people went down to be dipped in these a a little
fishing was done in the port and a quantity of strolling about by
night and looking seaward particularly at those times when the tide
made and was near flood small tradesmen who did no business whatever
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter

as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen became
again charged with mist and vapour mr lorry s thoughts seemed to cloud
too when it was dark and he sat before the coffee room fire awaiting
his dinner a she had awaited his breakfast his mind was busily digging
digging digging in the live red coals

a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work
mr lorry had been idle along time and had just poured out his last
glass ful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street and rumbled into the inn yard

he set down his glass untouched this is mam selle said he

in a very few minutes the waiter came into announce that miss manette
had arrived from london and would be happy to see the gentleman from
tell sons

so soon

miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required none
then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tell sons
immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience

the gentleman from tell sons had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manette s apartment
it was a large darkroom furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables these had been oiled and
oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if they were buried in deep
graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dugout

the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorry picking his
way over the well worn turkey carpet supposed miss manette to be for
the moment in some adjacent room until having got past the two tall
candles he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire a young lady of not more than seventeen in a riding cloak
and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand as
his eyes rested on a shorts light pretty figure a quantity of golden
hair a pair of blue eyes that me this own with an inquiring look and
a forehead with a singular capacity remembering how young and smooth
it was of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity or wonder oral armor merely of a bright
fixed attention though it included all the four expressions as his
eyes rested on these things a sudden vivid likeness passed before him
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
channel one cold time when the hail drifted heavily and these aran
high the likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier glass behind her on the frame of which a hospital
procession of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were
offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender and he made his formal bow to miss manette

pray take a seats irina very clear and pleasant young voice a
little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed

i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of an earlier
date a she made his formal bow again and took his seat

i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that
some intelligence or discovery

the word is not material miss either word will do

respecting the small property of my poor father whom in ever saw so
long dead

mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids as if they had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets

rendered it necessary that i should goto paris there to communicate
with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched to paris for
the purpose

myself

as i was prepared to hear sir

she curtsey ed to him young ladies made curtsey sin those days with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she he made her another bow

i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by
those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should goto
france and that asia man orphan and have no friend who could go with
me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself
during the journey under that worthy gentlemans protection the
gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here

i was happy said mr lorry to been trusted with the charge i shall
be more happy to execute it

siri thankyou indeed i thankyou very gratefully it was told me
by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature i have done my best to prepare myself and i naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are

naturally said mr lorry yes i

after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears it is very difficult to begin

he did not begin but in his in decision met her glance the young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression but it was pretty
and characteristic besides being singular and she raised her hand
as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed some passing
shadow

are you quite a stranger to me sir

amino tmr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile

between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing he watched her as shem used and the
moment she raised here yes again went on

in your adopted country i presume i can not do better than address you
as a young english lady miss manette

if you please sir

miss manette i am a man of business i have a business charge to
acquit myself of in your reception of it don the ed me anymore than
if i was a speaking machine truly i am not much else i will with
your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our customers

story

he seemed wilfully to mistake the words he had repeated when he added
in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers he was a french gentleman a scientific
gentleman a man of great acquirements a doctor

not of beauvais

why yes of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the
gentleman was of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the
gentleman was of repute in paris i had the honour of knowing him there
our relations were business relations but confidential i was at that
time in our french house and had been oh twenty years

at that time i may ask at what time sir

is peak miss of twenty years ago he married an english lady and
i was one of the trustees his affairs like the affairs of many other
french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tell sons hands
in a similar way i amori have been trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers these are mere business relations miss
there is no friendship in them no particular interest nothing like
sentiment i have passed from one to another in the course of my
business life just as i pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day in short i have no feeling siam a mere
machine to go on

but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to think the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him that when i was
left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father only two years
it was you who brought me to england i am almost sure it was you

mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confiding ly advanced
to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips he then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding
the chair back with his lefthand and using his right by turns to rub
his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his

miss manette it was i and you will see how truly i spoke of myself
just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the relations i hold
with my fellow creatures are mere business relations when you reflect
that i have never seen you since no you have been the ward of
tell sons house since and i have been busy with the other business of
tell sons house since feelings i have no time for them no chance
of them i pass my whole life miss in turning an immense pecuniary
mangle

after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most
unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before and resumed his former attitude

so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your
regretted father now comes the difference if your father had not died
when he did dont be frightened how you start

she did indeed start and she caught his wrist with both her hands

pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his lefthand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the suppli ca tory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitation a matter of
business as i was saying

her looks odis composed him that he stopped wandered and began a new

as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though no art could
trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper across the water there for instance the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of anyone
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his wife had
implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any tidings of
him and all quite in vain then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor of beauvais

i entreat you to tell me more sir

i william going to you can bear it

i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment

you speak collected ly and you are collected thats good though
his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter of business
regard it as a matter of business business that must be done now
if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage and spirit
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
born

the little child was a daughter sir

a daughter a a matter of business dont be distressed miss if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead no dont kneel in
heavens name why should you kneel to me

for the truth o dear good compassionate sir for the truth

a a matter of business you confuse me and how can itransact
business if i am confused let us be clearheaded if you could kindly
mention now for instance what nine times nine pence are or how many
shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging i should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind

without directly answering to this appeals he sat so still when he had
very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been that she
communicated some reassurance to mr jarvis lorry

thats right thats right courage business you have business before
you useful business miss manette your mother took this course with
you and when she died i believe brokenhearted having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father she left you at two years old
to grow to be blooming beautiful and happy without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison or wasted there through many lingering years

a she said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the
flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey

you know that your parents had no great possession and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you there has been no new
discovery of money or of any other property but

he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped the expression in the
forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which was
now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror

but he has been been found he is alive greatly changed it is too
probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the best
still alive your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in paris and we are going there i to identify him if i can you to
restore him to life love duty rest comfort

a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his she said in a
low distinct a we stricken voice as if she were saying it in a dream

i am going to see his ghost it will be his ghost not him

mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm there there
there see now see now the best and the worst are known to you now
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair
sea voyage and a fairland journey you will be soon a this dear side

she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free i
have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me

only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention he has been found under
another name his own long forgotten or long concealed it would be
worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly
held prisoner it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries
because it would be dangerous better not to mention the subject
anywhere or in anyway and to remove him for a while at all
events out of france even i safe as an englishman and even
tell sons important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of
the matter i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it this is a secret service altogether my credentials entries
and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to life
which may mean anything but what is the matters he doesnt notice a
word miss manette

perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair she
sat under his hand utterly insensible with here yes open and fixed
upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead so close washer hold upon his arm that he
feared to detach himself les the should hurt her therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving

a wild looking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observed to
be all of a red colour and to have redhair and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight fitting fashion and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good measure too
or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his chest and sending him
flying back against the nearest wall

i really think this must beaman was mr lorry s breathless
reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall

why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn servants
why dont you go and fetch things instead of standing there staring
at me i am not so much to look atami why dont you go and fetch
things ill let you know if you dont bring smelling salts cold
water and vinegar quick i will

there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she
softly laid the patient on as of a and tended her with great skill and
gentleness calling her my precious and my bird and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care

and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorry
couldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening her
to death look at her with her pretty paleface and her cold hands do
you call that being a banker

mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler
sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know something
not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
upon her shoulder

i hope she will do well now said mr lorry

no thanks to you in brown if she does my darling pretty

i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility that you accompany miss manette to france

a likely thing too replied the strong woman if it was ever
intended that i should go across saltwater do you suppose providence
would have cast my lot in an island

this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorry withdrew to
consider it




v the wine shop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street the
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had tumbled
out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine shop shattered like a walnut shell

all the people within reach had suspended their business or their
idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine the rough irregular
stones of the street pointing every way and designed one might have
thought expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them
had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded each by its own
jostling group or crowd according to its size some men kneeled down
made scoops of their two hands joined and sipped or tried to help
women who bent over their shoulders to sip before the wine had all
run out between their fingers others men and women dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware or even with
handkerchiefs from womens heads which were squeezed dry into infants
mouths others made small mud embankments to stem the wine as it ran
others directed by lookers on up at high windows darted here and
there to cutoff little streams of wine that started away in new
directions others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed
pieces of the cask licking and even champing the moister wine rotted
fragments with eager relish there was no drainage to carry off the
wine and not only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up
along with it that there might have been a scavenger in the street
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence

a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices voices of men women
and children resounded in the street while this wine game lasted there
was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness there was a
special companionship in it an observable inclination on the part
of everyone to join some other one which led especially among the
luckier or lighter hearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of health s
shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing a dozen
together when the wine was gone and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers these
demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out the man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting set it in
motion again the women who had left on a doorstep the little pot of
hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes or in those of her child returned to it men
with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous faces who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars moved away to descend again and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine

the wine was redwine and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilled it had
stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many
wooden shoes the hands of the man who sawed the wood left red marks
on the billets and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was
stained with the stain of the old rags he wound about her head again
those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask had acquired a
tiger ish smear about the mouth and one tall joker so besmirched his
head more out of along squalid bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees blood

the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the
street stones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there

and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was
heavy cold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence nobles of great power all of them
but most especially the last samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and re grinding in the mill and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young shivered at every corner
passed in and out at every doorway looked from every window fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the winds hook the mill which
had worked them down was the mill that grinds young people old the
children had ancient faces and grave voices and upon them and upon the
grown faces and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up a fresh
was the sigh hunger it was prevalent everywhere hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys and started up from the filthy street that had no offal
among its refuse of anything to eat hunger was the inscription on the
bakers shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread at the sausage shop in every dead dog preparation that
was offered for sale hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant
drops of oil

its abiding place was in all things fitted to it a narrow winding
street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets
diverging all people d by rags and night caps and all smelling of rags
and night caps and all visible things with a brooding lookup on them
that looked ill in the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay depressed and
slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wanting among them nor
compressed lips white with what they suppressed nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows rope they m used about enduring or
inflicting the trade signs and they were almost as many as the shops
were all grim illustrations of want the butcher and the pork man
painted up only the leanest s crags of meat the baker the coarsest of
meagre loaves the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine shops
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer and were
glowering ly confidential together nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition save tools and weapons but the cutlers knives
and axes were sharp and bright the smiths hammers were heavy and the
gun makers stock was murderous the crippling stones of the pavement
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but
broke off abruptly at the doors the kennel to make amends ran down
the middle of the street when it ran at all which was only after heavy
rains and then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses across
the streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down and lighted
and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea indeed they were at sea and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest

for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger so
long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the darkness of their
condition but the time was not come yet and every wind that blew over
france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain for the birds fine of
song and feather took no warning

the wine shop was a cornershop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wine shop had stood outside
it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine its not my affairs aid he with a final shrug
of the shoulders the people from the market did it let them bring
another

there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke
he called to him across the way

say then my gaspard what do you do there

the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often
the way with his tribe it missed its mark and completely failed as is
often the way with his tribe too

what now are you a subject for the mad hospital said the wine shop
keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it why do you write
in the public streets is there tell me thou is there no other place
to write such words in

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally
perhaps not upon the jokers heart the joker rapped it with his
own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand and held out a joker of an extremely not to say wolfish ly
practical character he looked under those circumstances

put it on put it on said the other call wine wine and finish
there with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers
dress such as it was quite deliberately as having dirtied the hand on
his account and then re crossed the road and entered the wine shop

this wine shopkeeper was a bull necked martial looking man of thirty
and he should have been of a hot temperament for although it was a
bitter day he wore no coat but carried ones lung over his shoulder
his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply curling short dark hair he was a darkman altogether with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them good humoured looking on
the whole but implacable looking too evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose a man not desirable to be met rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side for nothing would turn
the man

madame defarge his wife satin the shop behind the counter a she
came in madame defarge was a stout woman of about his ownage with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand
heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure of
manner there was a character about madame defarge from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckoning s over which she presided madame defarge being
sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large
earrings her knitting was before her but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick thus engaged with her right elbow supported
by her lefthand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but
coughed just one grain of cough this in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way

the wine shopkeeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in
a corner other company were there two playing cards two playing
dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine a she passed behind the counter he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man

what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieur defarge
to himself i dont know you

but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter

how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defarge is
all the spilt wine swallowed

every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge

when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge
picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line

it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur
defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or
of anything but black bread and death is it not so jacques

it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned

at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still
using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of
cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line

the last of the three now said his say a she put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips

ah so much the worse a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques am i
right jacques

you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows up and
slightly rustled in her seat

hold then true muttered her husband gentlemen my wife

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three
flourishes she acknowledged their homage by bending her head and
giving them a quicklook then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine shop took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit and became absorbed in it

gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eye observant ly
upon her good day the chamber furnished bachelor fashion that you
wished to see and were inquiring for when i stepped out is on the
fifth floor the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here pointing with his hand near to the window of
my establishment but now that i remember one of you has already been
there and can show the way gentlemen adieu

they paid for their wine and left the place the eyes of monsieur
defarge were studying his wi feather knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word

willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to
the door

their conference was very short but very decided almost at the first
word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive it had
not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady and they too went out madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and saw nothing

mr jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wine shop thus
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before it opened from a stinking little black courtyard
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses inhabited
by a great number of people in the gloomy tile paved entry to the
gloomy tile paved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master and put her hand to his lips it was
a gentle action but not at all gently done a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few second she had no good humour
in his face nor any openness of aspect left but had become a secret
angry dangerous man

it is very high it is a little difficult better to begin slowly
thus monsieur defarge in astern voice to mr lorry as they began
ascending the stairs

is he alone the latter whispered

alone god help him who should be with him said the other in the
same low voice

is he always alone then

yes

of his own desire

of his own necessity a she was when i first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if i would take him and at my peril be
discreet a she was then so he is now

he is greatly changed

changed

the keeper of the wine shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand
and mutter a tremendous curse no direct answer could have been half so
forcible mr lorry s spirits grew heavier and heavier a she and his
two companions ascended higher and higher

such a staircase with its accessories in the older and more crowded
parts of paris would be bad enough now but at that time it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and un hardened senses every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building that is to say
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase left its own heap of refuse on its own landing besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows the uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted
the air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable through such an atmosphere by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison the waylay yielding to his own disturbance of mind and to
his young companions agitation which became greater every instant mr
jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted seemed to escape and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawlin through the rusted bars tastes rather than glimpses were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood and nothing within range nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre dame had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations

at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped for the
third time there was yet an upper staircase of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions to be ascended before the garret story
was reached the keeper of the wine shop always going a little in
advance and always going on the side which mr lorry took as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady turned himself about
here and carefully feeling in the pockets of the coa the carried over
his shoulder took out a key

the door is locked then my friend said mr lorry surprised

ay yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge

you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired

i think it necessary to turn the key monsieur defarge whispered it
closer in his ear and frowned heavily

why

why because he has lived so long locked up that he would be
frightened rave tear himself to pieces die come to i know not what
harm if his door was left open

is it possible exclaimed mr lorry

is it possible repeated defarge bitterly yes and a beautiful
world we live in when it is possible and when many other such things
are possible and not only possible but done done see you under
that sky there everyday long live the devil let us go on

this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word
of it had reached the young lady sears but by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety
and above all such dread and terror that mr lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance

courage dear miss courage business the worst will be over in a
moment it is but passing the room door and the worst is over then
all the good you bring to him all the relief all the happiness you
bring to him begin let our good friend here assist you on that side
that swell friend defarge come now business business

they went up slowly and softly the staircase was short and they were
soon at the top there as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at
once insight of three men whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged through some chinks or holes in the wall on hearing
footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine shop

i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieur
defarge leave us good boys we have business here

the three glided by and went silently down

there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of
the wine shop going straight to this one when they were left alone mr
lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger

do you make a show of monsieur manette

is how him in the way you have seen to a chosen few

is that well

i think it is well

who are the few how do you choose them

i choose them as real men of my name jacques is my name to whom the
sight is likely to do goodenough you are english that is another
thing stay there if you please a little moment

with an ad monitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in
through the crevice in the wall soon raising his head again he struck
twice or thrice upon the door evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there with the same intention he drew the key across it
three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned
it as heavily a she could

the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the
room and said something a faint voice answered something little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side

he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter mr lorry
go this arm securely round the daughters waist and held her for he
felt that she was sinking

aaa business business he urged with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek come income in

i am afraid of it she answered shuddering

of it what

i mean of him of my father

rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room he sather
down just within the door and held her clinging to him

defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside
took out the key again and held it in his hand all this he did
methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise a she
could make finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was he stopped there and faced round

the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim
and dark for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the
roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any
other door of french construction to exclude the cold one half of this
door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way
such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it
was difficult on first coming into see anything and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in anyone the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity yet work of that kind was being
done in the garret for with his back towards the door and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine shop stood looking at
him a white haired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very
busy making shoes




vi the shoemaker


good day said monsieur defarge looking down at the whitehead that
bent low over the shoemaking

it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation as if it were at a distance

good day

you are still hard at work i see

after along silence the head was lifted for another moment and the
voice replied yes i am working this time a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again

the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful it was not the
faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it its deplorable peculiarity was that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse it was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago so entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain so sunken and
suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground so expressive
it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered
home and friends in such at one before lying down to die

some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked
up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical
perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood was not yet empty

i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker
to let in a little more light here you can bear a little more

the shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listening
at the floor on one side of him then similarly at the floor on the
other side of him then upward at the speaker

what did you say

you can bear a little more light

i must bear it if you let it in laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word

the opened half door was opened a little further and secured at that
angle for the time abroad ray of light fell into the garret and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lappa using in his
labour his few common tools and various scraps of leather were a this
feet and on his bench he had a whitebear dragged ly cut but not very
long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes the hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really
otherwise but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body
to be withered and worn he and his old canvas frock and his loose
stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in along seclusion
from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment yellow that it would have been hard to say which was which

he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones
of it seemed transparent so he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze
pausing in his work he never looked at the figure before him without
first looking down on this side of himself the non that as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spoke without
first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak

are you going to finish that pair of shoes today asked defarge
motioning to mr lorry to come forward

what did you say

do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today

icant say that i mean to i suppose so i dont know

but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again

mr lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door when
he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker
looked up he showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips a she looked at
i this lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour and then
the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe the
look and the action had occupied but an instant

you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge

what did you say

here is a visitor

the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his
work

come said defarge here is monsieur who knows a well made shoe when
he sees one show him that shoe you are working at take it monsieur

mr lorry took it in his hand

tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name

there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied

i forget what it was you asked me what did you say

i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieur s
information

it is a ladys shoe it is a young ladys walking shoe it is in the
present mode in ever saw the mode i have had a pattern in my hand he
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride

and the makers name said defarge

now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the righthand
in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the lefthand in the
hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and
soon in regular changes without a moments intermission the task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or
endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a
fast dying man

did you ask me for my name

assuredly i did

one hundred and five north tower

is that all

one hundred and five north tower

with a weary sound that was not a sigh nora groan he bent to work
again until the silence was again broken

you are not a shoemaker by trade said mr lorry looking steadfastly
at him

his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground

i am not a shoemaker by trade no i was not a shoemaker by trade ii
learnt i there i taught myself i asked leave to

h elapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time his eyes came slowly back at last to the face
from which they had wandered when they rested on i the started and
resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a
subject of last night

i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficulty after
along while and i have made shoes ever since

a she held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him mr
lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face

monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me

the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner

monsieur manette mr lorry laid his hand upon defarge sarm do you
remember nothing of this man look at him look at me is there no old
banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your
mind monsieur manette

as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at mr
lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him they were over clouded
again they were fainter they were gone but they had been there and
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where
she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and
shutout the sight of him but which were now extending towards him
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast and love it back to life and hope so exactly was the expression
repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her

darkness had fallen on him in its place he looked at the two less and
less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way finally with a deep long sigh he
took the shoe up and resumed his work

have you recognised him monsieur asked defarge in a whisper

yes for a moment at first i thought it quite hopeless but i have
unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew so
well hush let us draw further back hush

she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on
which he sat there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him a she stooped
over his labour

not a word was spoken not a sound was made she stood like a spirit
beside him and he bent over his work

it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand for his shoemakers knife it lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood he had taken it up and was
stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress he
raised them and saw her face the two spectators started forward
but she stayed them with a motion of her hands he had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife though they had

he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began
to form some words though no sound proceeded from them by degrees in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say

what is this

with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her
lips and kissed them to him then clasped the mon her breast as if she
laid his ruined head there

you are not the gaoler s daughter

she sighed no

who are you

not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench
beside him here coiled but she laid her hand upon his arma strange
thrills truck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame he
laid the knife down softly ashes at star in gather

her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed
aside and fell down over her neck advancing his hand by little and
little he took it up and looked at it in the midst of the action
he went astray and with another deep sigh fell to work a this
shoemaking

but not for long releasing his arms he laid her hand upon his
shoulder after looking doubtfully at it two or three times as if to
be sure that it was really there he laid down his work put his hand
to his neck and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to i the opened this carefully on his knee and it contained
a very little quantity of hair not more than one or two long golden
hairs which he had in some old day wound off upon his finger

he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at it it is
the same how can it be when was it how was it

as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too he turned her full to the
light and looked at her

she had laid her head upon my shoulder that night when i was summoned
out she had a fear of my going though i had none and when i was
brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve you will
leave me them they can never help me to escape in the body though they
may in the spirit those were the words i said i remember them very
well

he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it
but when he did find spoken words for it they came to him coherently
though slowly

how was this was it you

once more the two spectators started a she turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness but she sat perfectly still in his grasp and only
said in a low voice i entreat you good gentlemen do not come near
us do not speak do not move

hark he exclaimed whose voice was that

his hands released her a she uttered this cry and went up to his white
hair which they to reina frenzy it died out as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him and here folded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast but he still looked at her and
gloomily shook his head

no no no you are too young too blooming it cant be see what the
prisoner is these are not the hands she knew this is not the face
she knew this is not a voice she ever heard no no she was and he
was before the slow years of the north tower ages ago what is your
name my gentle angel

hailing his softened tone and manner his daughter fell upon her knees
before him with her appealing hands upon his breast

o sir at another time you shall know my name and who my mother was
and who my father and how in ever knew their hard hard history but i
can not tell you at this time and i can not tell you here all that i may
tell you here and now is that i pray to you to touch me and to bless
me kiss me kiss meo my dear my dear

his cold whitehead mingled with her radiant hair which warmed and
light edit as though it were the light of freedom shining on him

if you hear in my voice i dont know that it is so but i hope it
is if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in you rear sweep for it weep for it if you touch in
touching my hair anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free weep for it weep for it if when
i hint to you of a home that is before us where i will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service i bring back the
remembrance of a home long desolate while your poor heart pineda way
weep for it weep for it

she held him closer round the neck and rocked him on her breast like a
child

if when i tell you dearest dear that your agony is over and that i
have come here to take you from it and that we goto england to beat
peace and at rest i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste
and of our native france so wicked to you weep for it weep for it and
if when i shall tell you of my name and of my father who is living
and of my mother who is dead you learn that i have to kneel to my
honoured father and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and la in awake and wept all night because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me weep for it weep for it weep
for her then and for me good gentlemen thank god i feel his sacred
tears upon my face and his sobs strike against my hear to see thank
god for us thank god

he had sunk in her arms and his face dropped on her breast a sight so
touching yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it that the two be holders covered their faces

when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms emblem to humanity of there stand silence into which the storm
called life must hush at last they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground he had gradually dropped to the floor and lay
there in a lethargy worn out she had nestled down with him that his
head might lie upon her armand her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light

if without disturbing him she said raising her hand to mr lorry as
he stooped over them after repeated blowing s of his nose all could be
arranged for our leaving paris at once so that from the very door he
could be taken away

but consider is he fit for the journey asked mr lorry

more fit for that i think than to remain in this city so dreadful to
him

it is true said defarge who was kneeling to look on and hear more
than that monsieur manette is for all reasons best out of france
say shall i hire a carriage and post horses

thats business said mr lorry resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners and if business is to be done i had better do it

then be so kind urged miss manette as to leave us here you see how
composed he has become and you can not be afraid to leave him with me
now why should you be if you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption i do not doubt that you will find him when you comeback
as quiet as you leave him in any case i will take care of him until
you return and then we will remove him straight

both mr lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course and
in favour of one of them remaining but as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to but travelling papers and as time pressed
for the day was drawing to an end it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done and hurrying away
to do it

then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him the darkness
deepened and deepened and they both lay quiet until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall

mr lorry and monsieur defarge had made allready for the journey and
had brought with them besides travelling cloaks and wrappers bread and
meat wine and hot coffee monsieur defarge put this provender and the
lamp he carried on the shoemakers bench there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed and he and mr lorry roused the captive and
assisted him to his feet

no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind in
the scared blank wonder of his face whether he knew what had happened
whether here collected what they had said to him whether he knew that
he was free were questions which no sagacity could have solved they
tried speaking to him but he was so confused and so very slow to
answer that they took fright a this bewilderment and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more he had a wild lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands that had not been seen
in him before ye the had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughters voice and invariably turned to it when she spoke

in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink and put on the cloak
and other wrappings that they gave him to wear he readily responded to
his daughters drawing her arm through his and took and kept her hand
in both his own

they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lamp mr
lorry closing the little procession they had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped and stared at the roof and
round at the walls

you remember the place my father you remember coming up here

what did you say

but before she could repeat the question he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it

remember no i dont remember it was so very long ago

that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house was apparent to them they heard him mutter
one hundred and five north tower and when he looked about him it
evidently was for the strong fortress walls which had long encompassed
him on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread as being in expectation of a drawbridge and when there was
no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street he
dropped his daughters hand and clasped his head again

no crowd was about the door no people were discernible at any of the
many windows not even a chance passerby was in the street an unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there only one soul was to be seen and
that was madame defarge who leaned against the door post knitting and
saw nothing

the prisoner had got into a coach and his daughter had followed
him when mr lorry s feet were arrested on the step by his asking
miserably for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes madame
defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them and
went knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard she quickly
brought them down and handed them in and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door post knitting and saw nothing

defarge got upon the box and gave the word to the barrier the
postilion cracked his whip and they clattered away under the feeble
over swinging lamps

under the over swinging lamps swinging ever brighter in the better
streets and ever dimmer in the worse and by lighted shops gay crowds
illuminated coffeehouses and theatre doors to one of the city
gates soldiers with lanterns at the guardhouse there your papers
travellers see here then monsieur the officer said defarge
getting down and taking him gravely apart these are the papers of
monsieur inside with the whitehead they were consigned to me with
him at the he dropped his voice there was aflutter among the
military lanterns and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform the eyes connected with the arm looked not an everyday
or an everynight look at monsieur with the whitehead it is well
forward from the uniform adieu from defarge and sounder a short
grove of feebler and feeble rover swinging lamps out under the great
grove of stars

beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights some so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done the shadows of the night were broad and black
all through the cold and restless interval until dawn they once more
whispered in the ears of mr jarvis lorry sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dugout and wondering what subtle powers were forever
lost to him and what were capable of restoration the old inquiry

i hope you care to be recalled to life

and the old answer

icant say


the end of the first book





book the second the golden thread




i five years later


tell sons bank by temple bar was an oldfashioned place even in the
year one thousands even hundred and eighty it was very small very
dark very ugly very in commodious it was an oldfashioned place
moreover in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were
proud of its smallness proud of its darkness proud of its ugliness
proud of its in commodious ness they were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars and were fired by an express conviction that if
it were less objectionable it would be less respectable this was
no passive belief but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business tell sons they said wanted
no elbow room tell sons wanted no light tell sons wanted no
embellishment noakes and cos might or snooks brothers might but
tell sons thank heaven

anyone of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding tell sons in this respect the house was much
on apar with the country which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable but were only the more respectable

thus it had come to pass that tell sons was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat you fell into tell sons down two steps
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop with two little
counters where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it while they examined the signature by the ding i est of
windows which were always under a shower bath of mud from fleet street
and which were made the d in gier by their own iron bars proper and the
heavy shadow of temple bar if your business necessitated your seeing
the house you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back
where you meditated on a misspent life until the house came with its
hands in its pockets and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight your money came out of or went into wormy old wooden
drawers particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut your banknotes had a musty odour as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two your deeds got into ext emporis ed strong rooms
made of kitchens and scull eries and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking house air your lighter boxes of family
papers went upstairs into a bar me cide room that always had a great
dining table in it and never had a dinner and where even in the year
one thousands even hundred and eighty the first letters written to you
by your old love or by your little children were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows by the heads
exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
abyssinia or a shante e

but indeed at that time putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions and not least of all with tell sons
death is natures remedy for all things and why not legislations
accordingly the forger was put to death the utter er of a bad note
was put to death the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death the
purl o in er of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death the holder
of a horse at tell sons door who made off with it was put to
death the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death the sounders of
three fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime were put to
death not that it did the least good in the way of prevention it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse but it cleared off as to this world the trouble of each
particular case and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after thus tell sons in its day like greater places of business
its contemporaries had taken so many lives that if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately
disposed of they would probably have excluded what little light the
groundfloor had in a rather significant manner

cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tell sons the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely when they took a young
man into tell sons london house they hid him somewhere till he was
old they kept him in a dark place like a cheese until he had the full
tells on flavour and blue mould upon him then only was he permitted to
be seen spectacularly poring over large books and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment

outside tell sons never by any means in it unless called in was an
oddjob man an occasional porter and messenger who served as the live
sign of the house he was never absent during business hours unless
upon an errand and then he was represented by his son a grisly urchin
of twelve who was his express image people understood that tell sons
in a stately way tolerated the oddjob man the house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post his surname was cruncher and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness in the
easterly parish church of hou ns ditch he had received the added
appellation of jerry

the scene was mr crunchers private lodging in hanging sword alley
whitefriars the time half past seven of the clock on a windy march
morning an no domini seventeen hundred and eighty mr cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes apparently under
the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it

mr crunchers apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood and were
but two in number even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one but they were very decently kept early as
it was on the windy march morning the room in which he lay a bed was
already scrubbed throughout and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast and the lumbering deal table a very clean white cloth
was spread

mr cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane like a harlequin
at home at first he slept heavily but by degrees began to roll
and surge in bed until he rose above the surface with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons at which juncture he
exclaimed in a voice of dire exasperation

bust me if she a in tati tag in

a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
person referred to

what said mr cruncher looking out of bed for a boot your eat it
ag in are you

after hailing the morn with this second salutation he threw a boot at
the woman as a third it was a very muddy boot and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with mr crunchers domestic economy that
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay

what said mr cruncher varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark what are you up to agger away ter

i was only saying my prayers

saying your prayers your ea nice woman what do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying ag in me

i was not praying against you i was praying for you

you werent and if you were i wont be took the liberty with here
your mothers a nice woman young jerry going a praying ag in your
fathers prosperity youve got a dutiful mother you have myson
youve got a religious mother you have my boy going and flopping
herself down and praying that the bread and butter maybe snatched out
of the mouth of her only child

master cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill and turning
to his mother strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board

and what do you suppose you conceited female said mr cruncher with
unconscious inconsistency that the worth of your prayers maybe
name the price that you put your prayers at

they only come from the heart jerry they are worth no more than
that

worth no more than that repeated mr cruncher they a int worth
much then whether or no i wont be prayed a gini tell you icant
afford it im not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking if
you must go flopping yourself down flop in favour of your husband and
child and not in opposition to em if i had had any but a unna tral
wife and this poorboy had had any but a unna tral mother i might
have made some money last week instead of being counter prayed and
counter mined and religiously circum went ed into the worst of luck
buu ust me said mr cruncher who all this time had been putting
on his clothes if i a int what with piety and one blowed thing and
another been cho used this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with young jerry dress yourself my
boy and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then and if you see any signs of more flopping give me a call for i
tell you here he addressed his wife once more i wont begone ag in
in this manner iamas rickety as a hackney coach im as sleepy as
laudanum my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldnt know if
it wasnt for the pain in em which was me and which somebody else yet
im none the better for it in pocket and its my suspicion that youve
been at it from morning tonight to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket and i wont put up with i tagger away ter and what do you
say now

growling in addition such phrases as ah yes you re religious too
you wouldnt put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child would you not you and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation mr cruncher be took
himself to his boot cleaning and his general preparation for business
in the meantime his son whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes
and whose young eyes stood close by one another as his fathers did
kept the required watch upon his mother he greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals by darting out of his sleeping closet where he made
his toilet with a suppressed cry of you are going to flop mother
hallo a father and after raising this fictitious alarm darting in
again with an un dutiful grin

mr crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast he resented mrs crunchers saying grace with particular
animosity

now agger away ter what are you up to at it again

his wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing

dont do it said mr crunches looking about as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wifes petitions i
a int a going to be blest out of house and home i wont have my witt les
blest off my table keep still

exceedingly red eyed and grim as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn jerry cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it growling over it like any four footed
inmate of a menagerie towards nine oclock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect and presenting as respectable and business like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with issued forth to the occupation
of the day

it could scarcely be called a trade inspite of his favourite
description of himself as a honest tradesman his stock consisted of
a wooden stool made out of a broken backed chair cut down which stool
young jerry walking a this fathers side carried every morning to
beneath the banking house window that was nearest temple bar where
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the oddjob mans
feet it formed the encampment for the day on this post of his mr
cruncher was as well known to fleet street and the temple as the bar
itself and was almost as in looking

encamped at a quarter before nine in good time to touch his
three cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed into tell sons
jerry took up his station on this windy march morning with young jerry
standing by him when not engaged in making forays through the bar to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose father and son
extremely like each other looking silently on at the morning traffic
in fleet street with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys
the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance that
the mature jerry bit and spat out straw while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
in fleet street

the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tell sons
establishment was put through the door and the word was given

porter wanted

hooray father here san early job to begin with

having thus given his parent godspeed young jerry seated himself on
the stool entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing and cogitate d

always rusty his fingers is always rusty muttered young jerry
where does my father get all that iron rust from he dont get no iron
rust here




ii a sight


you know the old bailey well no doubt said one of the oldest of
clerks to jerry the messenger

yees sir returned jerry in something of a dogged manner i do
know the bailey

just so and you know mr lorry

i know mr lorry sir much better than i know the bailey much
better said jerry not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question than i as a honest tradesman wish to know the bailey

very well find the door where the witnesses go in and show the
doorkeeper this note for mr lorry he will then let you in

into the court sir

into the court

mr crunchers eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another and to
interchange the inquiry what do you think of this

am i to wait in the court sir he asked as the result of that
conference

i am going to tell you the doorkeeper will pass the note to mr
lorry and do you make any gesture that will attract mr lorry s
attention and show him where you stand then what you have to do is
to remain there until he wants you

is that all sir

thats all he wishes to have a messenger at hand this is to tell him
you are there

as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and super scribed the note
mr cruncher after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting paper stage remarked

i suppose theyll be trying forgeries this morning

treason

thats quartering said jerry barbarous

it is the law remarked the ancient clerk turning his surprised
spectacles upon him it is the law

its hard in the law to spi leaman i think its hard enough to kill
him but its wery hard to s pile him sir

not at all retained the ancient clerk speak well of the law take
care of your chest and voice my good friend and leave the law to take
care of itself i give you that advice

its the damp sir what settles on my chest and voice said jerry i
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is

well well said the old clerk we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood some of us have damp ways and some of us have dry
ways here is the letter go along

jerry took the letter and remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of you area lean old one
too made his bow informed his son in passing of his destination
and went his way

they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outside newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it
but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised and where dire diseases were bred that came
into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulled him off the bench it
had more than once happened that the judge in the blackcap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him
for the rest the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn yard
from which pale travellers set out continually in carts and coaches on
a violent passage into the other world traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road and shaming few good citizens if any
so powerful is use and so desirable to be good use in the beginning it
was famous too for the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent also for
the whipping post another dear old institution very human ising and
softening to behold in action also for extensive transactions in
blood money another fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under heaven altogether the old bailey at that date was a choice
illustration of the precept that whatever is is right an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy did it not include the troublesome
consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong

making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought and handed in
his letter through a trap in it for people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play in bedlam only the
former entertainment was much the dearer therefore all the old bailey
doors were well guarded except indeed the social doors by which the
criminals got there and those were always left wide open

after some delay and demur the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way and allowed mr jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into
court

what son he asked in a whisper of the man he found himself next
to

nothing yet

whats coming on

the treason case

the quartering one eh

ah returned the man with a relish hell be drawn on a hurdle to
behalf hanged and then hell be taken down and sliced before his own
face and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on
and then his head will be chopped off and hell be cut into quarters
thats the sentence

if hes found guilty you mean to say jerry added by way of proviso

oh theyll find him guilty said the other dont you be afraid of
that

mr crunchers attention was here diverted to the doorkeeper whom he
saw making his way to mr lorry with the note in his hand mr lorry
sat at a table among the gentlemen in wigs not far from a wigged
gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundle of papers
before him and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets whose whole attention when mr cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand jerry attracted the notice of mr lorry who had stood up
to look for him and who quietly nodded and sat down again

what she got to do with the case asked the man he had spoken with

blest if i know said jerry

what have you got to do with it then if a person may inquire

blest if i know that either said jerry

the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court stopped the dialogue presently the dock became the
central point of interest two gaoler s who had been standing there
went out and the prisoner was brought in and put to the bar

everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling stared at him all the human breath in the place rolled
at him like a sea or a wind or a fire eager faces strained round
pillars and corners to get a sight of him spectators in back rows
stood up not to miss a hair of him people on the floor of the court
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them to help
themselves at anybody s cost to a view of him stood a tiptoe got
upon ledges stood upon next to nothing to see every inch of him
conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of newgate jerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
w he the had taken a she came along and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer and g in and tea and coffee and what not
that flowed at him and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain

the object of all this staring and blaring was a youngman of about
five and twenty well grown and well looking with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye his condition was that of a young gentleman he was plainly
dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which was long and
dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck more to be out
of his way than for ornament as an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun he was otherwise quite self possessed
bowed to the judge and stood quiet

the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at
was not a sort that elevated humanity had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence had there been a chance of anyone of its savage
details being spared by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled
was the sight the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn as under yielded the sensation whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest according to their several arts and
powers of self deceit the interest was at the root of it ogre ish

silence in the court charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to
an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle and jangle for that
he was a false traitor to our serene illustrious excellent and so
forth prince our lord the king by reason of his having on divers
occasions and by divers means and ways assisted lewis the french
king in his wars against our said serene illustrious excellent and
so forth that was to say by coming and going between the dominions of
our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth and those of the
said french lewis and wickedly falsely traitorous ly and otherwise
evil adverb i ously revealing to the said french lewis what forces our
said serene illustrious excellent and so forth had in preparation
to send to canada and north america this much jerry with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it made out with
huge satisfaction and so arrived circuit ously at the understanding that
the aforesaid and over and over again aforesaid charles darnay stood
there before him upon his trial that the jury were swearing in and
that mr attorney general was making ready to speak

the accused who was and who knew he was being mentally hanged
beheaded and quartered by everybody there neither flinched from
the situation nor assumed any theatrical air in i the was quiet and
attentive watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him so
composedly that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn the court was all be strewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever

over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light down
upon him crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it and had passed from its surface and this earths together haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved may have struck the prisoners mind be
that as it may a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face he looked up and when he saw the glass his
face flushed and his righthand pushed the herbs away

it happened that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left about on a level with his eyes there sat
in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested so immediately and so much to the changing of his
aspect that all the eyes that we returned upon him turned to them

the spectators saw in the two figures a young lady of little more than
twenty and a gentleman who was evidently her father a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair
and a certain indescribable intensity of face not of an active kind
but pondering and self communing when this expression was upon him he
looked as if he were old but when it was stirred and broken up as
it was now in a moment on his speaking to his daughter he became a
handsome man not past the prime of life

his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his armas she sat by
him and the other pressed upon it she had drawn close to him in her
dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused this had been so very
noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shown that star ers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her and the whisper went about
who are they

jerry the messenger who had made his own observations in his own
manner and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption stretched his neck to hear who they were the crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back at last it got
to jerry

witnesses

for which side

against

against what side

the prisoners

the judge whose eyes had gone in the general direction recalled them
leaned back in his seat and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand as mr attorney general rose to spin the rope grind the
axe and hammer the nails into the scaffold




iii a disappointment


mr attorney general had to inform the jury that the prisoner before
them though young in years was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life that this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of today or of yesterday or
even of last year or of the year before that it was certain the
prisoner had for longer than that been in the habit of passing and
re passing between france and england on secret business of which
he could give no honest account that if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered
that providence however had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach to ferret out the nature of the
prisoners schemes and struck with horror to disclose them to his
majestys chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council
that this patriot would be produced before them that his position and
attitude were on the whole sublime that he had been the prisoners
friend but at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom on the sacred altar of his country that if statues
were decreed in britain as in ancient greece and rome to public
benefactors this shining citizen would assuredly have had one that as
they were not so decreed he probably would not have one that virtue
as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have word for word at the tips of their tongues
where at the jurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages was in a manner contagious more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love of country
that the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the crown to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour had
communicated itself to the prisoners servant and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his masters table drawers and pockets
and secrete his papers that he mr attorney general was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant but that
in a general way he preferred him to his mr attorney generals
brothers and sisters and honoured him more than his mr
attorney generals father and mother that he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise that the evidence of these two
witnesses coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his majestys forces and of their disposition and preparation both by
sea and land and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power that these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoners handwriting but that it was all the
same that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions that the proof
would go back five years and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the british troops and the americans
that for these reasons the jury being a loyal jury a she knew they
were and being a responsible jury as they knew they were must
positively find the prisoner guilty and make an end of him whether
they liked it or not that they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows that they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows that they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows in short that
there never more could be for them or theirs any laying of heads upon
pillows at all unless the prisoners head was taken off that head
mr attorney general concluded by demanding of them in the name of
everything he could think of with around turn in it and on the faith
of his solemn ass ever ation that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone

when the attorney general ceased a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue flies were swarming about the prisoner in
anticipation of what he was soon to become when toned down again the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness box

mr solicitor general then following his leaders lead examined the
patriot john bars ad gentleman by name the story of his pure soul was
exactly what mr attorney general had described it to be perhaps if
it had a fault a little too exactly having released his noble bosom
of its burden he would have modestly withdrawn himself but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him sitting not far from mr
lorry begged to ask him a few questions the wigged gentleman sitting
opposite still looking at the ceiling of the court

had he ever been a spy himself no he scorned the base insinuation
what did he live upon his property where was his property he didnt
precisely remember where it was what was it no business of anybody s
had he inherited it yes he had from whom distant relation very
distant rather ever been in prison certainly not never in a debtors
prison didnt see what that had to do with it never in a debtors
prison come once again never yes how many times two or three
times not five or six perhaps of what profession gentleman ever
been kicked might have been frequently no ever kicked downstairs
decidedly not once received a kick on the top of a staircase and fell
downstairs of his own accord kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault but it was not true swear it was not true
positively ever live by cheating at play never ever live by play not
more than other gentlemen do ever borrowmoney of the prisoner yes
ever pay him no was not this intimacy with the prisoner in reality a
very slight one forced upon the prisoner in coaches inns and packets
no sure he saw the prisoner with these lists certain knew no more
about the lists no had not procured them himself for instance no
expect to get anything by this evidence no not in regular government
pay and employment to lay traps oh dear no or to do anything oh dear
no swear that over and over again no motives but motives of sheer
patriotism none whatever

the virtuous servant roger cly swore his way through the case at a
great rate he had taken service with the prisoner in good faith and
simplicity four years ago he had asked the prisoner aboard the calais
packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner had engaged him
he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity never thought of such a thing he began to have suspicions of
the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soon afterwards in arranging
his clothes while travelling he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoners pockets over and over again he had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoners desk he had not put them there first he
had seen the prisoners how these identical lists to french gentlemen
at calais and similar lists to french gentlemen both at calais and
boulogne he loved his country and couldnt bear it and had given
information he had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot
he had been maligned respecting a mustard pot but it turned out to be
only a plated one he had known the last witness seven or eight years
that was merely a coincidence he didnt call it a particularly curious
coincidence most coincidences were curious neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too he
was a true briton and hoped there were many like him

the blue flies buzzed again and mr attorney general called mr jarvis
lorry

mr jarvis lorry are you a clerk in tell sons bank

i am

on a certain friday night in november one thousands even hundred and
seventy five did business occasion you to travel between london and
dover by the mail

it did

were there any other passengers in the mail

two

did they a light on the road in the course of the night

they did

mr lorry lookup on the prisoner was he one of those two passengers

i can not undertake to say that he was

does he resemble either of these two passengers

both were so wrapped up and the night was so dark and we were all so
reserved that i can not undertake to say even that

mr lorry look again upon the prisoner supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them

no

you will not swear mr lorry that he was not one of them

no

so atleast you say he may have been one of them

yes except that i remember them both to have been like
myself timorous of highwaymen and the prisoner has not a timorous
air

did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity mr lorry

i certainly have seen that

mr lorry look once more upon the prisoner have you seen him to your
certain knowledge before

i have

when

i was returning from france a few days afterwards and at calais the
prisoner came onboard the packet ship in which i returned and made the
voyage with me

at what hour did he come onboard

at a little after midnight

in the dead of the night was he the only passenger who came onboard
at that untimely hour

he happened to be the only one

nevermind about happening mr lorry he was the only passenger who
came onboard in the dead of the night

he was

were you travelling alone mr lorry or with any companion

with two companions a gentleman and lady they are here

they are here had you any conversation with the prisoner

hardly any the weather was stormy and the passage long and rough and
i lay on as of a almost from shore to shore

miss manette

the young lady to whom all eyes had been turned before and were now
turned again stood up where she had sather father rose with her and
kept her hand drawn through his arm

miss manette lookup on the prisoner

to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth and beauty was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd
standing as it were apart with her on the edge of his grave not all
the staring curiosity that looked on could for the moment nerve him
to remain quite still his hurried righthand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart the buzz of the great flies was loud again

miss manette have you seen the prisoner before

yessir

where

onboard of the packet ship just now referred to sir and on the same
occasion

you are the young lady just now referred to

o most unhappily i am

the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the judge a she said something fiercely answer the questions put
to you and make no remark upon them

miss manette had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the channel

yessir

recall it

in the midst of a profound stillness she faintly began when the
gentleman came onboard

do you mean the prisoner inquired the judge knitting his brows

yes my lord

then say the prisoner

when the prisoner came onboard he noticed that my father turning
here yes lovingly to him a she stood beside her was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health my father was so reduced that i was
afraid to take him out of the air and i had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps and is at on the deck a this side to take
care of him there were no other passengers that night but we four
the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could
shelter my father from the wind and weather better than i had done i
had not known how to do it well not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour he did it for me he expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my fathers state and i am sure he
felt it that was the manner of our beginning to speak together

let me interrupt you for a moment had he come onboard alone

no

how many were with him

two french gentlemen

had they conferred together

they had conferred together until the last moment when it was
necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat

had any papers been handed about among them similar to these lists

some papers had been handed about among them but i dont know what
papers

like these in shape and size

possibly but indeed i dont know although they stood whispering very
near to me because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there it was a dull lamp and they
spoke very low and i did not hear what they said and saw only that
they looked at papers

now to the prisoners conversation miss manette

the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me which arose out
of my helpless situation a she was kind and good and useful to my
father i hope bursting into tears i may not repay him by doing him
harm today

buzzing from the blue flies

miss manette if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give which you must
give and which you can not escape from giving with great unwillingness
he is the only person present in that condition please to go on

he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name he said that this business
had within a few days taken him to france and might at intervals
take him backwards and forwards between france and england for along
time to come

did he say anything about america miss manette be particular

he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen and he said
that so far a she could judge it was a wrong and foolish one on
england spar the added in a jesting way that perhaps george
washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the
third but there was no harm in his way of saying this it was said
laughingly and to beguile the time

any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence and in the pauses when
she stopped for the judge to write it down watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against among the lookers on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court insomuch that a great majority
of the foreheads there might have been mirrors reflecting the witness
when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about george washington

mr attorney general now signified to my lord that he deemed it
necessary as a matter of precaution and form to call the young ladys
father doctor manette who was called accordingly

doctor manette lookup on the prisoner have you ever seen him before

once when he called at my lodgings in london some three years or
three years and a half ago

can you identify him as your fellow passenger onboard the packet or
speak to his conversation with your daughter

siri can do neither

is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either

he answered in a low voice there is

has it been your misfortune to undergo along imprisonment without
trial or even accusation in your native country doctor manette

he answered in at one that went to every heart along imprisonment

were you newly released on the occasion in question

they tell me so

have you no remembrance of the occasion

none my mind is a blank from sometime i can not even say what
time when i employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to the
time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter
here she had become familiar to me when a gracious god restored
my faculties but i am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar i have no remembrance of the process

mr attorney general sat down and the father and daughters at down
together

a singular circumstance then arose in the case the object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down with some fellow plotter untracked
in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago and
got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did
not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more
to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required
in the coffee room of an hotel in that garrison and dockyard town
waiting for another person the prisoners counsel was cross examining
this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him opening
this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner

you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner

the witness was quite sure

did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner

not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken

look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the
prisoner how say you are they very like each other

allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise
not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought
into comparison my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wigand giving no very gracious consent the likeness became
much more remarkable my lord inquired of mrs try ver the prisoners
counsel whether they were next to try mr carton name of my learned
friend for treason but mrs try ver replied to my lord nobu the
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might
happen twice whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so
confident having seen it and more the upshot of which was to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber

mr cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence he had now to attend while mr
s try ver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit
of clothes showing them how the patriot bars ad was a hired spy and
traitor an un blushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas which he certainly did look
rather like how the virtuous servant cly was his friend and partner
and was worthy to be how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
s wearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family
affairs in france he being of french extraction did require his making
those passages across the channel though what those affairs were a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him
even for his life to disclose how the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent
gallant ries and politeness es likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together with the exception of that
reference to george washington which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke
how it would be a weakness in the government to breakdown in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears and therefore mr attorney general had made the most of it
how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the
state trials of this country were full but there my lord interposed
with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions

mrs try ver then called his few witnesses and mr cruncher had next to
attend while mr attorney general turned the whole suit of clothes mr
s try ver had fitted on the jury inside out showing how bars ad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the
prisoner a hundred times worse lastly came my lord himself turning
the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave clothes for the prisoner

and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again

mr carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court
changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement
while his learned friend mrs try ver massing his papers before him
whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury while all the spectators moved more or less and
grouped themselves a new while even my lord himself arose from his seat
and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish this one man
sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his
hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him
a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness
when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the
lookers on taking note of him now said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so a like mr cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour and added id hold half a guinea
that he dont get no law work to do dont look like the sort of one
to get any do he

yet this mr carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in for now when miss manette s head dropped upon
her fathers breast he was the first to see it and to say audibly
officer look to that young lady help the gentleman to take her out
dont you see she will fall

there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much
sympathy with her father it had evidently been a great distress to
him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled he had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud
ever since a she passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a
moment spoke through their foreman

they were not agreed and wished to retire my lord perhaps with george
washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward
and retired himself the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in
the court were now being light edit began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out along while the spectators dropped off to get
refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat
down

mr lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out
now reappeared and beckoned to jerry who in the slackened interest
could easily get near him

jerry if you wish to take something to eat you can but keep in the
way you will be sure to hear when the jury come in dont be a moment
behind them for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank you
are the quickest messenger i know and will get to temple bar long
before i can

jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling mr carton came up
at the moment and touched mr lorry on the arm

how is the young lady

she is greatly distressed but her father is comforting her and she
feels the better for being out of court

ill tell the prisoner so it wont do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you to be seen speaking to him publicly you know

mr lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind and mr carton made his way to the outside of the bar
the way out of court lay in that direction and jerry followed him all
eyes ears and spikes

mr darnay

the prisoner came forward directly

you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness miss manette she
will do very well you have seen the worst of her agitation

i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it could you tell her so
for me with my fervent acknowledgments

yes i could i will if you ask it

mr cartons manner was so careless as to be almost insolent he stood
half turned from the prisoner lounging with his elbow against the bar

i do ask it accept my cordial thanks

what said carton still only half turned towards him do you expect
mr darnay

the worst

its the wisest thing to expect and the likeliest but i think their
withdrawing is in your favour

loitering on the way out of court not being allowed jerry heard no
more but left them so like each other in feature so unlike each other
in manner standing side by side both reflected in the glass above
them

an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief and rascal crowded
passages below eventhough assisted off with mutton pies andale
the hoarse messenger uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection had dropped into a doze when aloud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court carried him along
with them

jerry jerry mr lorry was already calling at the door when he got
there

here sir its a fight to get back again here i am sir

mr lorry handed him a paper through the throng quick have you got
it

yessir

hastily written on the paper was the word acquitted

if you had sent the message recalled to life again muttered
jerry a she turned i should have known what you meant this time

he had no opportunity of saying or so much as thinking anything else
until he was clear of the old bailey for the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs and aloud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion




iv congratulatory


from the dimly lighted passages of the court the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day was straining off when
doctor manette lucie manette his daughter mr lorry the solicitor
for the defence and its counsel mrs try ver stood gathered round mr
charles darnay just released congratulating him on his escape from
death

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light to recognise
in doctor manette intellectual of face and upright of bearing the
shoemaker of the garret in paris yet no one could have looked at him
twice without looking again eventhough the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice and
to the abstraction that over clouded him fitfully without any apparent
reason while one external cause and that a reference to his long
lingering agony would always as on the trial evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul it was also in its nature to arise of
itself and to draw a gloom over him as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun when the substance was three
hundred miles away

only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his
misery and to a present beyond his misery and the sound of her voice
the light of her face the touch of her hand had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always not absolutely always for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed but they were few
and slight and she believed them over

mr darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully and had turned
to mrs try ver whom he warmly thanked mrs try vera man of little
more than thirty but looking twenty years older than he was stout
loud red bluff and free from any drawback of delicacy had a pushing
way of shouldering himself morally and physically into companies and
conversations that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life

he still had his wigand gown on and he said squaring himself a this
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr lorry clean
out of the group i am glad to have brought you off with honour mr
darnay it was an infamous prosecution grossly infamous but not the
less likely to succeed on that account

you have laid me under an obligation to you for life in two senses
said his late client taking his hand

i have done my best for you mr darnay and my best is as good as
another mansi believe

it clearly being incumbent on someone to say much better mr lorry
said it perhaps not quite disinterested ly but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again

you think so said mrs try ver well you have been present all day
and you ought to know you area man of business too

and as such quoth mr lorry whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group just a she had previously shouldered
him out of it as such i will appeal to doctor manette to breakup
this conference and order us all to our homes miss lucie looks ill mr
darnay has had a terrible day we are worn out

speak for yourself mr lorry said s try veri have a nights work to
do yet speak for yourself

is peak for myself answered mr lorry and for mr darnay and for
miss lucie and miss lucie do you not think i may speak for us all
he asked her the question pointedly and with a glance at her father

his face had become frozen as it were in a very curious look at
darnay an intent look deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust
not even unmixed with fear with this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away

my father said lucie softly laying her hand on his

he slowly shook the shadow off and turned to her

shall we go home my father

with along breath he answered yes

the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed under the
impression which he himself had originated that he would not be
released that night the lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages their on gates were being closed with ajar and a rattle
and the dismal place was deserted until tomorrow mornings interest of
gallows pillory whipping post and branding iron should re people it
walking between her father and mr darnay lucie manette passed into
the openair a hackney coach was called and the father and daughter
departed in it

mrs try ver had left them in the passages to shoulder his wayback
to the robin groom another person who had not joined the group or
interchanged a word with anyone of them but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest had silently strolled
out after there stand had looked on until the coach drove away he now
stepped up to where mr lorry and mr darnay stood upon the pavement

so mr lorry men of business may speak to mr darnay now

nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr cartons part in the days
proceedings nobody had known of i the was un robed and was none the
better for it in appearance

if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind when the
business mind is divided between good natured impulse and business
appearances you would beam used mr darnay

mr lorry reddened and said warmly you have mentioned that before
sir we men of business who serve a house are not our own masters we
have to think of the house more than ourselves

i know i know rejoined mr carton carelessly dont be
nettled mr lorry you areas good as another i have no doubt better
i daresay

and indeed sir pursued mr lorry not minding him i really dont
know what you have to do with the matter if youll excuse me as very
much your elder for saying so i really dont know that it is your
business

business bless you i have no business said mr carton

it is a pity you have not sir

i think so too

if you had pursued mr lorry perhaps you would attend to it

lord love you no i shouldnt said mr carton

well sir cried mr lorry thoroughly heated by his indifference
business is a very good thing and a very respectable thing and sir
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments mr
darnay as a young gentleman of generosity know show to make allowance
for that circumstance mr darnay goodnight god bless you sir
i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life chair there

perhaps a little angry with himself as well as with the barrister mr
lorry bustled into the chair and was carried off to tell sons carton
who smelt of port wine and did not appear to be quite sober laughed
then and turned to darnay

this is a strange chance that throws you and me together this must
beast range night to you standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones

i hardly seem yet returned charles darnay to belong to this world
again

i dont wonder at it its not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another you speak faintly

i begin to think i am faint

then why the devil dont you dinei dined myself while those
num skulls were deliberating which world you should belong to this or
some other let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at

drawing his arm through his own he took him down ludgate hill to
fleet street and soup a covered way into a tavern here they were
shown into a little room where charles darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine while cartons at
opposite to him at the same table with his separate bottle of port
before him and his fully half insolent manner upon him

do you feel yet that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again mr
darnay

i am frightfully confused regarding time and place but i am so far
mended as to feel that

it must bean immense satisfaction

he said it bitterly and filled up his glass again which was a large
one

as to me the greatest desire i have is to forget that i belong to it
it has no good in it for me except wine like this nor i for it so we
are not much a like in that particular indeed i begin to think we are
not much a like in any particular you and i

confused by the emotion of the day and feeling his being there with
this double of coarse deportment to be like a dream charles darnay was
at a loss how to answer finally answered not at all

now your dinner is done carton presently said why dont you call a
health mr darnay why dont you give your toast

what health what toast

why its on the tip of your tongue it ought to be it must be ill
swear its there

miss manette then

miss manette then

looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall where it shivered to
pieces then rang the bell and ordered in another

that sa fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark mr darnay
he said filling his new goblet

as light frown and a laconic yes were the answer

that sa fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by how does it
feel is it worth being tried for ones life to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion mr darnay

again darnay answered not a word

she was mightily pleased to have your message when i gave it her not
that she showed she was pleased but i suppose she was

the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this
disagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him in the
strait of the day he turned the dialogue to that point and thanked him
for it

in either want any thanks nor merit any was the careless rejoinder
it was nothing to do in the first place and i dont know why i did
it in the second mr darnay let me ask you a question

willingly and a small return for your good offices

do you think i particularly like you

really mr carton returned the other oddly disconcerted i have
not asked myself the question

but ask yourself the question now

you have acted as if you do but i dont think you do

i dont think i do said cartoni begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding

nevertheless pursued darnay rising to ring the bell there is
nothing in that i hope to prevent my calling the reckoning and our
parting without ill blood on either side

carton rejoining nothing in life darnay rang do you call the whole
reckoning said carton on his answering in the affirmative then
bring me another pint of this same wine drawer and come and wake meat
ten

the bill being paid charles darnay rose and wished him goodnight
without returning the wish carton rose too with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner and said a last word mr darnay you think
i am drunk

i think you have been drinking mr carton

think you know i have been drinking

since i must say so i know it

then you shall likewise know why i am a disappointed drudge siri
care for no man on earth and no man on earth cares for me

much to be regretted you might have used your talents better

maybe so mr darnay maybe not dont let your sober face e late you
however you dont know what it may come to goodnight

when he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went to a
glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely in it

do you particularly like the man he muttered a this own image why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you there is nothing
in you to like you know that ah confound you what a change you have
made in yourself a good reason for taking to a man that he shows you
what you have fallen away from and what you might have been change
places with him and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was and commiserated by that agitated face a she was come on and
have it out in plain words you hate the fellow

here sorted to his pint of wine for consolation drank it all in a few
minutes and fell asleep on his arms with his hair straggling over the
table and along winding sheet in the candle dripping down upon him




v the jackal


those were drinking days and most men drank hard so very great is
the improvement time has brought about in such habits that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman would seem in these days a ridiculous exaggeration
the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities neither was mr
s try ver already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice behind his com peers in this particular anymore than in the
drier parts of the legal race

a favourite at the old bailey and eke at the sessions mrs try ver had
begun cautiously to he w away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite
specially to their longing arms and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the lord chief justice in the court of kings bench the
florid countenance of mrs try ver might be daily seen bursting out of
the bed of wigs like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden full of flaring companions

it had once been noted at the bar that while mrs try ver was a glib
man and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments
but a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this the more
business he got the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney
carton he always had his points a this fingers ends in the morning

sydney carton idle stand most unpromising of men was s try vers great
ally what the two drank together between hilary term and michaelmas
might have floated a kings ships try ver never had a case in hand
anywhere but carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring
at the ceiling of the court they went the same circuit and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings like a dissipated cat at last it began to get about
among such as were interested in the matter that although sydney carton
would never be a lion he was an amazingly good jackal and that he
rendered suit and service to s try ver in that humble capacity

ten oclock sir said the man at the tavern whom he had charged to
wake him ten oclock sir

whats the matter

ten oclock sir

what do you meant e no clock at night

yessir your honour told me to call you

oh i remember very well very well

after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes
he got up tossed his hat on and walked out he turned into the temple
and having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of kings
bench walk and paper buildings turned into the s try ver chambers

the s try ver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gone
home and the s try ver principal opened the door he had his slippers on
and a loose bed gown and his throat was bare for his greater ease he
had that rather wild strained seared marking about the eyes which
maybe observed in all free livers of his class from the portrait of
jeffries downward and which can be traced under various disguises of
art through the portraits of every drinking age

you area little late memory said s try ver

about the usual time it maybe a quarter of an hour later

they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers
where there was a blazing fire a kettle steamed upon the hob and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone with plenty of wine upon
it and brandy and rum and sugar and lemons

you have had your bottle i perceive sydney

two tonight i think i have been dining with the days client or
seeing him dine its all one

that was a rare point sydney that you brought to bear upon the
identification how did you come by it when did it strike you

i though the was rather a handsome fellow and i thought i should have
been much the same sort of fellow if i had had any luck

mrs try ver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch

you and your luck sydney get to work get to work

sullenly enough the jackal loosened his dress went into an adjoining
room and came back with a large jug of coldwater a basin and a towel
or two steeping the towels in the water and partially wringing them
out he folded the mon his head in a manner hideous to behold sat down
at the table and said now i am ready

not much boiling down to be done tonight memory said mrs try ver
gaily a she looked among his papers

how much

only two sets of them

give me the worst first

there they are sydney fire away

the lion then composed himself on his back on as of a on one side of the
drinking table while the jackals at a this own paper be strewn table
proper on the other side of it with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand both resorted to the drinking table without stint but each in
a different way the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband looking at the fire or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document the jackal with knitted brows and intent face
so deep in his task that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass which often groped about for a minute or
more before it found the glass for his lips two or three times the
matter in hand became so knotty that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up and steep his towels a new from these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity

at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion and
proceeded to offer it to him the lion took it with care and caution
made his selections from it and his remarks upon it and the jackal
assisted both when there past was fully discussed the lion put his
hands in his waistband again and laydown to meditate the jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle and a fresh application
to his head and applied himself to the collection of a second meal
this was administered to the lion in the same manner and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning

and now we have done sydney fill a bumper of punch said mr
s try ver

the jackal removed the towels from his head which had been steaming
again shook himself yawned shivered and complied

you were very sound sydney in the matter of those crown witnesses
today every question told

i always am sound am i not

i dont gainsay it what has roughened your temper put some punch to
it and smooth it again

with a deprecatory grunt the jackal again complied

the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury schools aids try ver nodding
his head over him a she reviewed him in the present and the past the
old seesaw sydney up one minute and down the next now in spirits and
now in despondency

ah returned the other sighing yes the same sydney with the same
luck even then i did exercises for other boys and seldom did my own

and why not

god knows it was my way i suppose

he sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him looking at the fire

carton said his friend squaring himself at him with a bullying air
as if the fire grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney
carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it your way
is and always was a lame way you summon no energy and purpose look
at me

oh both eration returned sydney with a lighter and more
good humoured laugh dont you be moral

how have i done what i have done said s try ver how do i do what i
do

partly through paying me to help you i suppose but its not worth
your while to a post rop his e me or the air about it what you want to
do you do you were always in the front rank and i was always behind

i had to get into the front rank i was not born there was i

i was not present at the ceremony but my opinion is you were said
carton at this he laughed again and they both laughed

before shrewsbury and at shrewsbury and ever since shrewsbury
pursued carton you have fallen into your rank and i have fallen into
mine even when we were fellow students in the student quarter of paris
picking up french and french law and other french crumbs that we
didnt get much good of you were always somewhere and i was always
nowhere

and whose fault was that

upon my soul i am not sure that it was not yours you were always
driving an driving and shouldering and passing to that restless degree
that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose its a gloomy
thing however to talkabout ones own past with the day breaking
turn me in some other direction before i go

well then pledge me to the pretty witness said s try ver holding up
his glass are you turned in a pleasant direction

apparently not for he became gloomy again

pretty witness he muttered looking down into his glass i have had
enough of witnesses today and tonight whos your pretty witness

the picturesque doctors daughter miss manette

she pretty

is she not

no

why man alive she was the admiration of the whole court

rot the admiration of the whole court who made the old bailey a judge
of beauty she was a golden haired doll

do you know sydney said mrs try ver looking at him with sharp eyes
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face do you know i rather
thought at the time that you sympathised with the golden haired doll
and were quick to see what happened to the golden haired doll

quick to see what happened if a girl doll or no doll swoons within a
yard or two of a mans nose he can see it without a perspective glass
i pledge you but i deny the beauty and no will have no more drink
ill get to bed

when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle to light
him down the stairs the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows when he got out of the house the air was cold and sad the
dull sky overcast the river dark and dim the whole scene like a
lifeless desert and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast as if the deserts and had risen faraway and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city

waste forces within him and a desert all around this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace and saw for a moment lying in the
wilderness before him a mirage of honourable ambition self denial and
perseverance in the fair city of this vision there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening waters of hope that sparkled in his sight
a moment and it was gone climbing to a high chamber in a well of
house she threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears

sadly sadly the sun rose it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions incapable of their directed exercise
incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible of the blight
on him and resigning himself to let it eat him away




vi hundreds of people


the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street corner not
far from soho square on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason and carried
it as to the public interest and memory far out to sea mr jarvis
lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived
on his way to dine with the doctor after several relapses into
business absorption mr lorry had become the doctors friend and the
quiet street corner was the sunny part of his life

on this certain fine sunday mr lorry walked towards soho early in
the afternoon for three reasons of habit firstly because on fine
sunday she often walked out before dinner with the doctor and lucie
secondly because on unfavourable sunday she was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend talking reading looking out of window and
generally getting through the day thirdly because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew how the ways of the
doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them

aqua inter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not to be
found in london there was no way through it and the front windows of
the doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it there were few buildings then
north of the oxford road and forest trees flourished and wildflowers
grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanished fields as a
consequence country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement and there was many a good south wall not far off on which
the peaches ripened in their season

the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day but when the streets grew hot the corner was in shadow
though not in shadow so remote but that you could seebeyond it into a
glare of brightness it was a cool spot staid but cheerful a wonderful
place for echoes and a very harbour from the raging streets

there ought to have been a tranquil barkin such an anchorage and
there was the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house where
several callings purported to be pursued by day but where of little was
audible any day and which was shunned by all of them at night in
a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where a planetree
rustled its green leaves church organs claimed to be made and silver
to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall as if
he had beaten himself precious and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors very little of these trades or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live upstairs or of a dim coach trimming maker asserted to have
a counting house below was ever heard or seen occasionally astray
workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered
about there or a distant c link was heard across the courtyard or a
thump from the golden giant these however were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the planetree behind
the house and the echoes in the corner before it had their own way
from sunday morning unto saturday night

doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him
his scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and
he earned as much a she wanted

these things were within mr jarvis lorry s knowledge thoughts and
notice when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner
on the fine sunday afternoon

doctor manette at home

expected home

miss lucie at home

expected home

miss pros sat home

possibly at home but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pros sas to admission or denial of the
fact

asia mat home myself said mr lorry ill go upstairs

although the doctors daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics simple as the furniture was it was set off
by so many little adornments of no value but for their taste and fancy
that its effect was delightful the disposition of everything in the
rooms from the largest object to the least the arrangement of colours
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles by
delicate hands clear eyes and good sense were at once so pleasant in
themselves and so expressive of their originator that as mr lorry
stood looking about him the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time whether he approved

there were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all mr lorry smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him walked from one to another the first was
the best room and in it were lucie s birds and flowers and books
and desk and work table and box of watercolours the second was
the doctors consulting room used also as the diningroom the third
changing ly speckled by the rustle of the planetree in the yard was the
doctors bedroom and there in a corner stood the disused shoemakers
bench and tray of tools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine shop in the suburb of saint antoine in paris

i wonder said mr lorry pausing in his looking about that he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him

and why wonder at that was the abrupt inquiry that made him start

it proceeded from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose
acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover and
had since improved

i should have thought mr lorry began

pooh you d have thought said miss pross and mr lorry left off

how do you do inquired that lady then sharply and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice

i am pretty well i thankyou answered mr lorry with meekness how
are you

nothing to boast of said miss pross

indeed

ah indeed said miss pros siam very much put out about my
ladybird

indeed

for gracious sake say something else besides indeed or youll
fidget me to death said miss pross whose character dissociated from
stature was shortness

really then said mr lorry as an amendment

really is bad enough returned miss pross but better yes i am
very much put out

may i ask the cause

i dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird to
come here looking after her said miss pross

do dozens come for that purpose

hundreds said miss pross

it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her
time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned
she exaggerated it

dear me said mr lorry as the safest remark he could think of

i have lived with the darling or the darling has lived with me and
paid me for it which she certainly should never have done you may take
your affidavit if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing since she was ten years old and its really very hard
said miss pross

not seeing with precision what was very hard mr lorry shook his head
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything

allsorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet
are always turning up said miss pross when you began it

i began it miss pross

didnt you who brought her father to life

oh if that was beginning it said mr lorry

it wasnt ending it i suppose i say when you began it it was hard
enough not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is no imputation on
him for it was not to be expected that anybody should be under any
circumstances but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have for given
him to take ladybirds affections away from me

mr lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous but he also knew her by
this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one of those
unselfish creatures found only among women who will for pure love and
admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost
it to beauty that they never had to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre live she knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart so
rendered and so free from any mercenary tain the had such an exalted
respect for it that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind we all make such arrangements more or less he stationed miss
pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by nature and art who had balances at tell sons

there never was nor will be but one man worthy of ladybird said
miss pross and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made a
mistake in life

here again mr lorry s inquiries into miss pros ss personal history had
established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed as as take to
speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty forevermore with
no touch of compunction miss pros ss fidelity of belief in solomon
deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious
matter with mr lorry and had its weight in his good opinion of her

as we happen to be alone for the moment and are both people of
business he said when they had got back to the drawing room and had
sat down there in friendly relations let me ask you does the doctor
in talking with lucie never refer to the shoemaking time yet

never

and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him

ah returned miss pross shaking her head but i dont say he dont
refer to it within himself

do you believe that he thinks of it much

i do said miss pross

do you imagine mr lorry had begun when miss pross took him up
short with

never imagine anything have no imagination at all

i stand corrected do you suppose you go so far as to suppose
sometimes

now and then said miss pross

do you suppose mr lorry went on with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye as it looked kindly at her that doctor manette has any
theory of his own preserved through all those years relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed perhaps even to the name of his
oppressor

i dont suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me

and that is

that she think she has

now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because i am a
me red ullman of business and you area woman of business

dull miss pross inquired with placidity

rather wishing his modest adjective away mr lorry replied no no
no surely not to return to business is it not remarkable that doctor
manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is should never touch upon that question i will not say with me
though he had business relations with me many years ago and we are now
intimate i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached and who is so devotedly attached to him believe me miss
p rossi dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of
zealous interest

well to the best of my understanding and bad s the best youll tell
me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid
of the whole subject

afraid

its plain enough i should think why he maybe its a dreadful
remembrance besides that his loss of himself grew out of it not
knowing how he lost himself or how here covered himself he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again that alone wouldnt make the
subject pleasant i should think

it was a pro founder remark than mr lorry had looked for true said
he and fearful to reflect upon yet a doubt lurks in my mind miss
pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shutup within him indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence

cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head touch that
string and he instantly changes for the worse better leave it alone
in short must leave it alone like or no like sometimes he gets up in
the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking
up and down walking up and down in his room ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down walking up and down in
his old prison she hurries to him and they go on together walking up
and down walking up and down until he is composed but he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him in silence they go walking up and down
together walking up and down together till her love and company have
brought him to himself

notwithstanding miss pros ss denial of her own imagination there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea
in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to
her possessing such a thing

the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going

here they are said miss pross rising to breakup the conference
and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon

it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such a
peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorry stood at the open window
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied
they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though
the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them

miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking
off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and
folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vain est and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant
sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do
playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own
chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at
them and telling miss pros show she spoilt lucie in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would
have had more if it were possible mr lorry was a pleasant sight too
beaming at all this in his little wigand thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no
hundreds of people came to see the sights and mr lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of miss pros ss prediction

dinnertime and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of
the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and
always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest
quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their
contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be
better miss pros ss friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kinds he had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of
impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would
impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress
or cinderellas godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit
a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she
pleased

on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower
regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance on this occasion
miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too

it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the planetree and they should sit
there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her
they went out under the planetree and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of mr lorry she had installed herself some
time before as mr lorry scup bearer and while they sat under the
planetree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the planetree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads

still the hundreds of people did not present themselves mr darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the planetree but he
was only one

doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie but miss pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and
retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the
jerks

the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the
resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as
they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness

he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual
vivacity pray doctor manette said mr darnay as they sat under the
planetree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand
which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of
the tower

lucie and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of
it to know that it teems with interest little more

i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smile
though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a
curious thing when i was there

what was that lucie asked

in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which
had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a cornerstone
in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to
execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with
some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand
at first they were read as dic but on being more carefully
examined the last letter was found to beg there was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested
that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the
earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found
the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leather n case
or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he
had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler

my father exclaimed lucie you are ill

he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and
his look quite terrified them all

no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they
made me start we had better go in

here covered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large
drops and he showed the back of his hand with raindrops on it but he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of and as they went into the house the business eye of mr lorry
either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned
towards charles darnay the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the courthouse

here covered himself so quickly however that mr lorry had doubts of
his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and
that the rain had startled him

teatime and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerks upon
her and yet no hundreds of people mr carton had lounged in but he
made only two

the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and
windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was
done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the
heavy twilight lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton
leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of
the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the
ceiling and waved them like spectral wings

the raindrops are still falling large heavy and few said doctor
manette it comes slowly

it comes surely said carton

they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a
darkroom watching and waiting for lightning always do

there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a
footstep was there

a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay when they had
listened for a while

is it not impressive mr darnay asked lucie sometimes i have
sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight when all is so black and
solemn

let us shudder too we may know what it is

it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we
originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by and bye into our lives

there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so
sydney cartons truck in in his moody way

the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some
as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some
coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in
the distant streets and not one with insight

are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us miss manette or
are we to divide them among us

i dont know mr darnay it old you it was a foolish fancy but you
asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and
then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life and my fathers

i take them into mine said cartoni ask no questions and make no
stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us miss manette
and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window

and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they
come fast fierce and furious

it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him
for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moments
interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at
midnight

the great bell of saint pauls was striking one in the cleared air when
mr lorry escorted by jerry high booted and bearing a lantern set
forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches
of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mr lorry mindful
of footpads always retained jerry for this service though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier

what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr lorry to
bring the dead out of their graves

in ever see the night myself master nor yeti dont expect to what
would do that answered jerry

goodnight mr carton said the man of business goodnight mr
darnay shall we ever see such a night again together

perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar
bearing down upon them too




vii monseigneur in town


monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his
fortnightly reception in his grandhotel in paris monseigneur was in
his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiest s to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing france but his mornings chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four
strongmen besides the cook

yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the
chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket emu lative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to
conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur slips one lac quey carried
the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function
a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold
watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ig nobly waited on by only three
men he must have died of two

monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy
and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so
impress ible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance
for france as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted
days of the merry stuart who sold it

monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which
was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public
business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and
particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world
was made for them the text of his order altered from the original
by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness
there of are mine saith monseigneur

yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of
affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances
public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances
private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after
generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence
monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet
time toward off the impending veil the cheapest garments he could
wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general
poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer
rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked
down upon him with the loftiest contempt

a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his
stables twenty four male domestics satin his halls six body women
waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality was atleast the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day

for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and night caps elsewhere and not
so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost
equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have
been anybody s business at the house of monseigneur military officers
destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship
civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the
worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives
all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of
monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the
score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were
no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly
patients in the antechamber s of monseigneur projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a singles in poured their distracting babble into an years
they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving
philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making
card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving
chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been
since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various
not abilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies
among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half
of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and
appearance owned to being am other indeed except for theme react of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing
known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close
and brought them up and charming grandmamma s of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty

the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting
them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of convulsion ists and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam rage roar and turn ca tale pt icon the
spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the
future for monseigneur s guidance besides these dervishes were other
three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a
jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the
centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got
out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre
by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much
discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never
became manifest

but the comfort was that all the company at the grandhotel of
monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been
ascertained to be adress day everybody there would have been eternally
correct such frizz ling and powdering and sticking up of hair such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant
swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would
surely keep anything going forever and ever the exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets thatch inked as they
languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells
and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen there was aflutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and
his devouring hunger faraway

dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that
was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through
monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals
of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball
descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was
required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps
and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a
rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call
him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at
monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would
see the very stars out

monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiest s to be thrown
open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and
fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in
body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never
troubled it

bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of
truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due
course of time got himself shutup in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites and was seen no more

the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon
but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm
and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out

i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil

with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs

he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and
with a face like a fine mask a face of a transparent paleness every
feature in it clearly defined one set expression on it the nose
beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril in those two compression so rd ints the only little
change that the face ever showed resided they persisted in changing
colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation then they gave a look of
treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance examined with
attention its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of the eyes being much
too horizontal and thin still in the effect of the face made it was a
handsome face and a remarkable one

its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and
drove away not many people had talked with him at the reception he had
stood in a little space apart and monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner it appeared under the circumstances rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses and
often barely escaping from being rundown his man drove as if he were
charging an enemy and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face or to the lips of the master the complaint had
sometimes made itself audible even in that deaf city and dumb age
that in the narrow streets without footways the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner but few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time and in this matter as in all others the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could

with a wild rattle and clatter and an in human abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners with women screaming
before it and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was aloud cry from a
number of voices and the horses reared and plunged

but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would not have
stopped carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded
behind and why not but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry
and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles

what has gone wrong said monsieur calmly looking out

at allman in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountain and was
down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal

pardon monsieur the marquis said a ragged and submissive man it is
a child

why does he make that abominable noise is i this child

excuse me monsieur the marquis it is a pity yes

the fountain was a little removed for the street opened where it was
into a space some tenor twelve yards square as the tallman suddenly
got up from the ground and came running at the carriage monsieur the
marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt

killed shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both arms at
their length above his head and staring at him dead

the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis there was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness there was no visible menacing or anger neither did the
people say anything after the first cry they had been silent and they
remained so the voice of the submissive man who had spoken was flat
and tame in its extreme submission monsieur the marquis ran his eyes
over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes

he took out his purse

it is extraordinary to me said he that you people can not take care
of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is forever in
the way how do i know what injury you have done my horses see give
him that

he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pickup and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell the
tallman called out again with a most unearthly cry dead

he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom the rest
made way on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder
sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it they
were as silent however as the men

i know all i know all said the last comer be a brave man my
gaspard it is better for the poor little plaything to die so than to
live it has died in a moment without pain could it have lived an hour
as happily

you area philosopher you there said the marquis smiling how do
they call you

they call me defarge

of what trade

monsieur the marquis vendor of wine

pickup that philosopher and vendor of wine said the marquis
throwing him another gold coin and spend it as you will the horses
there are they right

without deign ing to look at the assemblage a second time monsieur the
marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing and had
paid for it and could afford to pay for it when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor

hold said monsieur the marquis hold the horses who threw that

he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood a
moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman knitting

you dogs said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchanged front
except as to the spots on his nose i would ride over any of you very
willingly and exterminate you from the earth if i knew which rascal
threw at the carriage and if that brigand were sufficiently near i the
should be crushed under the wheels

so cowed was their condition and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them within the law and beyond it that not
a voice or a hand or even an eye was raised among the men not one
but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the
marquis in the face it was not for his dignity to notice i this
contemptuous eyes passed over her and overall the other rats and he
leaned back in his seat again and gave the word go on

he was driven on and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession the minister the state projector the farmer general the
doctor the lawyer the ecclesiastic the grand opera the comedy the
whole fancy ballina bright continuous flow came whirling by the rats
had crept out of their holes to look on and they remained looking
on for hours soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk and through
which they peeped the father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountains at there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous knitting still knitted on with the steadfastness
of fate the water of the fountain ran the swift river ran the day ran
into evening so much life in the city ran into death according to rule
time and tide waited for no man the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again the fancy ball was lighted up at supper all
things ran their course




viii monseigneur in the country


a beautiful landscape with the corn bright in it but not abundant
patches of poor rye where corn should have been patches of poor peas
and beans patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheaton
inanimate nature as on the men and women who cultivated it a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly a dejected
disposition to give up and wither away

monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been
lighter conducted by four post horses and two postilion s fagg ed up
a steep hill a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control the setting
sun

the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped in crimson it will
die out said monsieur the marquis glancing a this hands directly

in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down
hill with a cinder ous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed
quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off

but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village
at the bottom of the hill abroad sweep and rise beyond it a
church tower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison roundup on all these darkening objects
as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was
coming near home

the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor
tannery poor tavern poor stable yard for relays of post horses poor
fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all
its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors
shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the
fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yielding s of
the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor
were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax
for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be
paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until
the wonder was that there was any village left un swallowed

few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill
or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag

heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilion s
whips which twined snakelike about their heads in the evening air as
if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting house gate it was hard by the
fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him
he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow
sure filing down of misery worn face and figure that was to make the
meagre ness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years

monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him as the like of himself had drooped before
monseigneur of the court only the difference was that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group

bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier

the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain

i passed you on the road

monseigneur it is true i had the honour of being passed on the road

coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both

monseigneur it is true

what did you look at so fixedly

monseigneur i looked at the man

he stooped a little and with his tattered blue c appointed under the
carriage all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage

what man pig and why look there

pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoe the drag

who demanded the traveller

monseigneur the man

may the devil carry away these idiot show do you call the man you
know all the men of this part of the country who was he

your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the country of
all the days of my life in ever saw him

swinging by the chain to be suffocated

with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur
his head hanging over like this

he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his
face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down then recovered
himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow

what was he like

monseigneur he was whiter than the miller all covered with dust
white as aspect ret all as a spectre

the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd but all
eyes without comparing notes with other eyes looked at monsieur
the marquis perhaps to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience

truly you did well said the marquis felicitous ly sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him to see a thief accompanying my carriage
and not open that great mouth of yours bah put him aside monsieur
ga belle

monsieur ga belle was the postmaster and some other taxing functionary
united he had come out with great obsequious ness to assist at this
examination and had held the examined by the drapery of his armin an
official manner

bah go aside said monsieur ga belle

lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
tonight and be sure that his business is honest ga belle

monseigneur i am flattered to devote myself to your orders

did he runaway fellow where is that accursed

the accursed was already under the carriage with some half dozen
particular friends pointing out the chain with his blue cap some
half dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out and
presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis

did the man runaway dolt when we stopped for the drag

monseigneur he precipitated himself over the hillside head first as
a person plunges into the river

see to it gabel lego on

the half dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or
they might not have been so fortunate

the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond was soon checked by the steepness of the hill gradually
it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night the postilion s with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips the valet walked by the horses the
courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dull distance

at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground
with across and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor
figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had
studied the figure from the life his own life maybe for it was
dreadfully spare and thin

to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she
turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and
presented herself at the carriage door

it is you monseigneur monseigneur a petition

with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face
monseigneur looked out

how then what is it always petitions

monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester

what of your husband the forester always the same with you people he
can not pay something

he has paid all monseigneur he is dead

well he is quiet can i restore him to you

alas no monseigneur but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor
grass

well

monseigneur there are so many little heaps of poor grass

again well

she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate
grief by turns she clasped herve i nous and knotted hands together
with wild energy and laid one of the mon the carriage door tenderly
caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch

monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of
want so many die of want so many more will die of want

again well can i feed them

monseigneur the good god knows but id on task it my petition is
that a morsel of stone or wood with my husbands name maybe placed
over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will be quickly
forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady i
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass monseigneur they
are so many they increase so fast there is so much want monseigneur
monseigneur

the valet had put her away from the door the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot the postilion shad quickened the pace she was left far
behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau

the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him and rose as
the rainfalls impartially on the dusty ragged and to il worn group
at the fountain not faraway to whom the mender of roads with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre as long as they could bear it by degrees as they
could bear no more they dropped off one by one and lights twinkled
in little casements which lights as the casements darkened and more
stars came out seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished

the shadow of a large high roofed house and of many overhanging trees
was upon monsieur the marquis by that time and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau as his carriage stopped and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him

monsieur charles whom i expect is he arrived from england

monseigneur not yet




ix the gorgons head


it was a heavy mass of building that chateau of monsieur the marquis
with a largest one courtyard before it and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door as tony
business altogether with heavy stone balustrade sandstone urns and
stone flowers and stone faces of men and stone heads of lions in
all directions as if the gorgons head had surveyed it when it was
finished two centuries ago

up the broad flight of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeau
preceded went from his carriage sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from a nowlin the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees all else was so quiet that the
flambeau carried up the steps and the other flambeau held at the great
door burnt as if they were in a close room of state instead of being
in the open night air other sound than the owls voice there was none
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin for it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together and then
heave along low sigh and hold their breath again

the great door clanged behind him and monsieur the marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar spears swords and knives of the chase
grimmer with certain heavy riding rods and riding whips of which many a
peasant gone to his benefactor death had felt the weight when his lord
was angry

avoiding the larger rooms which were dark and made fast for the night
monsieur the marquis with his flambeau bearer going on before went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor this thrown open admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms his bedchamber and two
others high vaulted rooms with cool un carpeted floors great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in wintertime and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country
the fashion of the last louis but one of the line that was never to
break the fourteenth louis was conspicuous in their rich furniture
but it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of france

as upper table was laid for two in the third of the rooms around
room in one of the chateaus four extinguisher topped towers a small
lofty room with its window wide open and the wooden jalousie blinds
closed so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black alternating with their broad lines of stone colour

my nephew said the marquis glancing at the supper preparation they
said he was not arrived

nor was he but he had been expected with monseigneur

a hit is not probable he will arrive tonight nevertheless leave the
table as it is i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour

in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choices upper his chair was opposite to the window and
he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his
lips when he put it down

what is that he calmly asked looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour

monseigneur that

outside the blinds open the blinds

it was done

well

monseigneur it is nothing the trees and the night are all that are
here

the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked out into
the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind him looking round
for instructions

good said the imperturbable master close them again

that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper he was
halfway through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand
hearing the sound of wheels it came on briskly and came up to the
front of the chateau

ask who is arrived

it was the nephew of monseigneur he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur early in the afternoon he had diminished the distance
rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road
he had heard of monseigneur at the posting houses as being before him

he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and
there and that he was prayed to come to it in a little while he came
he had been known in england as charles darnay

monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shake
hands

you left paris yesterday sir he said to monseigneur a she took his
seat at table

yesterday and you

i come direct

from london

yes

you have been along time coming said the marquis with a smile

on the contrary i come direct

pardon me i mean not along time on the journey along time
intending the journey

i have been detained by the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer various business

without doubt said the polished uncle

so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them
when coffee had been served and they were alone together the nephew
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask opened a conversation

i have comeback sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that
took me away it carried me into great and unexpected peril but it is
a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have
sustained me

not to death said the uncle it is not necessary to say to death

i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there

the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly as light form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring

indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me

no no no said the uncle pleasantly

but however that maybe resumed the nephew glancing at him with
deep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means
and would know no scruple as to means

my friend it old you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation in the
two marks dome the favour to recall that it old you so long ago

i recall it

thankyou said the marquis very sweetly indeed

histone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musical
instrument

in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to beat once your
bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in
france here

i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffee
dare i ask you to explain

i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years pasta letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely

it is possible said the uncle with great calmness for the honour
of the family i could even resolve to in commode you to that extent
pray excuse me

i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before
yesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew

i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle with refined
politeness i would not be sure of that a good opportunity for
consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence
yourdestiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself but it is useless to discuss the question iamas you say
at a disadvantage these little instruments of correction these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that
might so in commode you are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity they are sought by so many and they are granted
comparatively to so few it used not to be so but france in all such
things is changed for the worse our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar from this room many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged in the next room my bedroom
one fellow to our knowledge was poni a rded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter his daughter we have
lost many privileges a new philosophy has become the mode and the
assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as
to say would but might cause us real inconvenience all very bad very
bad

the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his head
as elegantly despondent a she could becoming ly be of a country still
containing himself that great means of regeneration

we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern
time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our name to be
more detested than any name in france

let us hope so said the uncle detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low

there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face i can
look at in all this country roundabout us which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery

a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the family
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur
hah and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff and lightly
crossed his legs

but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness closeness
and dislike than was com portable with its wearers assumption of
indifference

repression is the only lasting philosophy the dark deference of fear
and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to it shuts
out the sky

that might not be so long as the marquis supposed if a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence could have been shown to
him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly fire charred plunder wrecked rains as for the roof
he vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new
way to wit forever from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets

meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour and repose
of the family if you will not but you must be fatigued shall we
terminate our conference for the night

a moment more

an hour if you please

sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits
of wrong

we have done wrong repeated the marquis with an inquiring smile
and delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself

our family our honourable family whose honour is of so much account
to both of us in such different ways even in my fathers time we did
a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure whatever it was why need is peak of my fathers time
when it is equally your scan i separate my fathers twin brother joint
inheritor and next successor from himself

death has done that said the marquis

and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that is
frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother slips and obey the last
look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to
redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain

seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him on the
breast with his forefinger they were now standing by the hearth you
will forever seek them in vain be assured

every fine straightline in the clear whiteness of his face was
cruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood looking
quietly a this nephew with his snuff box in his hand once again he
touched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword with which in delicate finesse her an him through the
body and said

my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have
lived

when he had said i the took a culminating pinch of snuff and put his
box in his pocket

better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing a small
bell on the table and accept your natural destiny but you are lost
monsieur charles i see

this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadly i
renounce them

are they both yours to renounce france maybe but is the property it
is scarcely worth mentioning but is it yet

i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet if it passed
to me from you tomorrow

which i have the vanity to hope is not probable

or twenty years hence

you dome too much honour said the marquis still i prefer that
supposition

i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere it is little to
relinquish what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin

hah said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room

to the eye it is fair enough here but seen in its integrity
under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste
mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hunger nakedness
and suffering

hah said the marquis again in a well satisfied manner

if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the
weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who can not leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in
another generation suffer less but it is not for me there is a curse
on it and on all this land

and you said the uncle forgive my curiosity do you under your new
philosophy graciously intend to live

i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at
their backs may have to do someday work

in england for example

yes the family honours iris safe from me in this country the
family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other

the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to be
light edit now shone brightly through the door of communication the
marquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of his
valet

england is very attractive to you seeing how in differently you have
prospered there he observed then turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile

i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may
be indebted to you sir for the rest it is my refuge

they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of many you
know a compatriot who has found a refuge there a doctor

yes

with a daughter

yes

yes said the marquis you are fatigued goodnight

a she ben this head in his most courtly manner there was a secrecy
in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly at the same
time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes and the thin
straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic

yes repeated the marquis a doctor with a daughter yes so
commences the new philosophy you are fatigued goodnight

it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his the nephew
looked at him in vain in passing on to the door

goodnight said the uncle i look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning good repose light monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will he
added to himself before he rang his little bell again and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom

the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber robe to prepare himself gently for sleep that hot still
night rustling about the room his softly slipper ed feet making no
noise on the floor he moved like a refined tiger looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitent ly wicked sort in story whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going of for just
coming on

he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again at the
scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind the slow
to il up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent the mill the
prison on the crag the little village in the hollow the peasants at
the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue c appointing out the
chain under the carriage that fountain suggested the paris fountain
the little bundle lying on the step the women bending over it and the
tallman with his arms up crying dead

i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may goto bed

so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth hele this thin
gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break its silence
with along sigh a she composed himself to sleep

the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the blacknight
for three heavy hours for three heavy hours the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men poets but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them

for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion and human
stared blindly at the night dead darkness lay on all the landscape
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads
the burial place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another the figure on the cross might
have come down for anything that could be seen of it in the village
tax ers and taxed were fast asleep dreaming perhaps of banquets as
the starved usually do and of ease and rest as the driven slave and
the yoke do x may its lean inhabitants slept soundly and were fed and
freed

the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard both melting away like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of time through three dark
hours then the greywater of both began to be ghostly in the light
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened

lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees and poured its radiance over the hill in the glow the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stone faces
crimson ed the carol of the birds was loud and high and on the
weather beaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieur
the marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might
at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed and with open
mouth and dropped under jaw looked a we stricken

now the sun was full up and movement began in the village casement
windows opened crazy doors were un barred and people came forth
shivering chilled as yet by the new sweet air then began the rarely
lightened to il of the day among the village population some to the
fountain some to the fields men and women here to dig and delve men
and women there to see to the poor livestock and lead the bony cows
out to such pasture as could be found by the roadside in the church
and at the cross a kneeling figure or two attendant on the latter
prayers the led cow trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot

the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awoke gradually and
surely first the lonely boar spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old then had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine
now doors and windows were thrown open horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways leaves sparkled and rustled at iron grated windows dogs
pulled hard at their chains and reared impatient to be loosed

all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life and the
return of morning surely not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau nor the running up and down the stairs nor the hurried
figures on the terrace nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away

what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads already
at work on the hilltop beyond the village with his days dinner not
much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crows while to
peck at on a heap of stones had the birds carrying some grains of it
to a distance dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds whether or
no the mender of roads ran on the sultry morning as if for his life
down the hill knee high indust and never stopped till he got to the
fountain

all the people of the village were at the fountain standing about
in their depressed manner and whispering low but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise the led cows hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them were looking stupidly
on or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter some of
the people of the chateau and some of those of the posting house and
all the taxing authorities were armed more or less and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way that was
highly fraught with nothing already the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap what did all this portend
and what portended the swift hoisting up of monsieur ga belle behind
a servant on horseback and the conveying away of the said ga belle
double laden though the horse was at a gallop like a new version of
the german ballad of leonora

it portended that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau

the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night and had added
the one stone face wanting the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years

it layback on the pillow of monsieur the marquis it was like a fine
mask suddenly startled made angry and petrified driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it was a knife round its hilt
was a frill of paper on which was scrawled

drive him fast to his tomb this from jacques




x two promises


more months to the number of twelve had come and gone and mr charles
darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french
language who was conversant with french literature in this age he
would have been a professor in that age he was atutor he read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy he could write of them besides in
sound english and render them into sound english such masters were not
at that time easily found princes that had been and kings that were
to be were not yet of the teacher class and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of tell sons ledgers to turn cooks and carpenters as a
tutor whose attainments made the students way unusually pleasant and
profitable and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge young mr darnay soon became
known and encouraged he was well acquainted moreover with the
circumstances of his country and those were of ever growing interest
so with great perseverance and untiring industry he prospered

in london he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold nor
to lie on beds of roses if he had had any such exalted expectation he
would not have prospered he had expected labour and he found it and
did it and made the best of it in this his prosperity consisted

a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in european languages instead of conveying greek
and latin through the customhouse the rest of his time he passed in
london

now from the days when it was always summer in eden to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes the world of a man has
invariably gone one way charles darnay sway the way of the love of a
woman

he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger he had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him but he had not yet spoken to her on the subject the assassination
at the deserted chateau faraway beyond the heaving water and the long
long dusty roads the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream had been done a year and he had never yet by so
much as a single spoken word disclosed to her the state of his heart

that he had his reasons for this he knew full well it was again a
summer day when lately arrived in london from his college occupation
he turned into the quiet corner in soho benton seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to doctor manette it was the close of the summer
day and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross

he found the doctor reading in his armchair at a window the energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness had been gradually restored to him he was now a
very energetic man indeed with great firmness of purpose strength
of resolution and vigour of action in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden a she had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties but this had never been
frequently observable and had grown more and more rare

he studied much slept little sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease and was equ ably cheerful to him now entered charles darnay at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand

charles darnay i rejoice to see you we have been counting on your
return these three or four days past mrs try ver and sydney carton were
both here yesterday and both made you out to be more than due

i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter he answered
a little coldly as to them though very warmly as to the doctor miss
manette

is well said the doctor a she stopped short and your return will
delight us all she has gone out on some household matters but will
soon be home

doctor manette i knew she was from home i took the opportunity of her
being from home to beg to speak to you

there was a blank silence

yes said the doctor with evident constraint bring your chair here
and speak on

he complied as to the chair but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy

i have had the happiness doctor manette of being so intimate here
so heat length began for some year and a half that i hope the topic
on which i am about to touch may not

he was stayed by the doctors putting out his hand to stop him when he
had kept it so a little while he said drawing it back

is lucie the topic

she is

it is hard for me to speak of her at anytime it is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours charles darnay

it is at one of fervent admiration true homage and deep love doctor
manette he said deferentially

there was another blank silence before her father rejoined

i believe it i do you justice i believe it

his constraint was so manifest and it was so manifest too that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject that charles
darnay hesitated

shall i go on sir

another blank

yes go on

you anticipate what i would say though you can not know how earnestly
i say it how earnestly i feel it without knowing my secret heart and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden dear doctor manette i love your daughter fondly dearly
disinterested ly devotedly if ever there were love in the world i love
her you have loved yourself let your old love speak for me

the doctors at with his face turned away and his eyes benton the
ground at the last words he stretched out his hand again hurriedly
and cried

not that sir let that be i adjure you do not recall that

his cry was so like a cry of actual pain that it rang in charles
darnay sears long after he had ceased he motioned with the hand he had
extended and it seemed to bean appeal to darnay to pause the latter
so received it and remained silent

i ask your pardon said the doctor in a subdued tone after some
moments i do not doubt your loving lucie you maybe satisfied of it

he turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him or
raise his eyes his chin dropped upon his hand and his white hair
overshadowed his face

have you spoken to lucie

no

nor written

never

it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that yourself denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father her father thanks
you

he offered his hand but his eyes did not go with it

i know said darnay respectfully how can i fail to know doctor
manette i who have seen you together from day today that between
you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual so touching so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured that it
can have few parallel seven in the tenderness between a father and
child i know doctor manette how can i fail to know that mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman there
is in her heart towards you all the love and reliance of infancy
itself i know that as in her childhood she had no parent so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character united to the trust fulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her i know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life you could
hardly be invested in her sight with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her i know that when she is clinging to
you the hands of babygirl and woman all in one are round your
neck i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mo the rather
ownage sees and loves you at my age loves her mother brokenhearted
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration i
have known this night and day since i have known you in your home

her fathers at silent with his face bent down his breathing was a
little quickened but here pressed all other signs of agitation

dear doctor manette always knowing this always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you i have for borne and for borne as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it i have felt and do even
now feel that to bring my love even mine between you is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself but i love her
heaven is my witness that i love her

i believe it answered her father mournfully i have thought so
before now i believe it

but do not believe said darnay upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound that if my fortune were so cast as
that being one day so happy as to make her my wife i must at anytime
put any separation between her and you i could or would breathe a
word of what i now say besides that i should know it to be hopeless i
should know it to be a baseness if i had any such possibility even at
a remote distance of years harboured in my thoughts and hidden in my
heart if it ever had been there if it ever could be there i could not
now touch this honoured hand

he laid his own upon it a she spoke

no dear doctor manette like you a voluntary exile from france like
you driven from it by its distractions oppressions and miseries like
you striving to live away from it by my own exertions and trusting
in a happier future i look only to sharing your fortunes sharing your
life and home and being faithful to you to the death not to divide
with lucie her privilege as your child companion and friend but to
come in aid of it and bind her closer to you if such a thing can be

his touch still lingered on her fathers hand answering the touch for a
moment but not coldly her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference a struggle was evidently in his face a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread

you speak so feelingly and so manfully charles darnay that i thank
you with all my heart and will open all my heart or nearly so have
you any reason to believe that lucie loves you

none as yet none

is it the immediate object of this confidence that you may at once
ascertain that with my knowledge

not even so i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks i
might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow

do you seek any guidance from me

i ask none sir but i have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power if you should deem it right to give me some

do you seek any promise from me

i do seek that

what is it

i well understand that without you i could have no hope i well
understand that even if miss manette held meat this moment in her
innocent heart do not think i have the presumption to assume so much i
could retain no place in it against her love for her father

if that be so do you see what on the other hand is involved in it

i understand equally well that a word from her father in any suitors
favour would outweigh herself and all the world for which reason
doctor manette said darnay modestly but firmly i would not ask that
word to save my life

i am sure of it charles darnay mysteries arise out of close love as
well as out of wide division in the former case they are subtle and
delicate and difficult to penetrate my daughter lucie is in this one
respect such a mystery tomei can make no guess at the state of her
heart

may i ask sir if you think she is a she hesitated her father
supplied the rest

is sought by any other suitor

it is what i meant to say

her father considered a little before he answered

you have seen mr carton here yourself mrs try ver is here too
occasionally if it beat all it can only be by one of these

or both said darnay

i had not thought of both i should not think either likely you want
a promise from me tell me what it is

it is that if miss manette should bring to you at anytime on her own
part such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you you will
bear testimony to what i have said and to your belief in it i hope you
maybe able to think so well of me as to urge no influence against
me i say nothing more of my stake in this this is what i ask the
condition on which i ask it and which you have an undoubted right to
require i will observe immediately

i give the promise said the doctor without any condition i believe
your object to be purely and truthfully as you have stated it i
believe your intention is to perpetuate and not to weaken the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self if she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness i will give her to you
if there were charles darnay if there were

the youngman had taken his hand gratefully their hands were joined as
the doctor spoke

any fancies any reasons any apprehensions anything whatsoever
new or old against the man she really loved the direct responsibility
there of not lying on his head they should all be obliterated for her
sake she is everything to me more to me than suffering more to me
than wrong more to me well this is idle talk

so strange was the way in which he faded into silence and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak that darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it

you said something to me said doctor manette breaking into a smile
what was it you said to me

he was at a loss how to answer until he remembered having spoken of a
condition relieved as his mind reverted to that he answered

your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part my present name though but slightly changed from my mothers is
not as you will remember my own i wish to tell you what that is and
why i am in england

stop said the doctor of beauvais

i wish it that i may the better deserve your confidence and have no
secret from you

stop

for an instant the doctor even had his two hands a this ears for
another instant even had his two hands laid on darnay slips

tell me when i ask you not now if your suit should prosper if lucie
should love you you shall tell me on your marriage morning do you
promise

willingly

give me your hands he will be home directly and it is better she
should not see us together tonight go god bless you

it was dark when charles darnay left him and it was an hour later and
darker when lucie came home she hurried into the room alone for
miss pross had gone straight upstairs and was surprised to find his
reading chair empty

my father she called to him father dear

nothing was said in answer but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom passing lightly across the intermediate room she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened crying to herself with her
blood all chilled what shall i do what shall i do

her uncertainty lasted but a moment she hurried back and tapped at
his door and softly called to him the noise ceased at the sound of
her voice and he presently came out to her and they walked up and down
together for along time

she came down from herbed to look at him in his sleep that night he
slept heavily and his tray of shoemaking tools and his old unfinished
work were all as usual




xia companion picture


sydney said mrs try veron that selfsame night or morning to his
jackal mix another bowl of punch i have something to say to you

sydney had been working double tides that night and the night before
and the night before that and a good many nights in succession making
a grand clearance among mrs try vers papers before the setting in
of the long vacation the clearance was effected at last the s try ver
arrears were handsomely fetched up everything was got rid of until
november should come with its fogs atmospheric and fogs legal and
bring grist to the mill again

sydney was none the livelier and none the sober er for so much
application it had taken a deal of extra wet towelling to pull him
through the night a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling and he was in a very damaged condition a she now pulled
hist urban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours

are you mixing that other bowl of punch said s try ver the portly with
his hands in his waistband glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back

i am

now look here i am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me i intend to marry

do you

yes and not for money what do you say now

i dont feel disposed to say much who is she

guess

do i know her

guess

i am not going to guess at five oclock in the morning with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head if you want me to guess you must ask
me to dinner

well then ill tell you said s try ver coming slowly into a sitting
posture sydney i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you
because you are such an insensible dog

and you returned sydney busy concocting the punch are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit

come rejoined s try ver laughing boastfully though i dont prefer
any claim to being the soul of romance for i hope i know better still
i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you

you area luckier if you mean that

i dont mean that i mean i am a man of more more

say gallantry while you are about it suggested carton

well ill say gallantry my meaning is that i a mama nsaids try ver
inflating himself a this friend a she made the punch who cares more to
be agreeable who takes more pains to be agreeable who knows better how
to be agreeable in a womans society than you do

go on said sydney carton

no but before i goons aids try ver shaking his head in his bullying
way ill have this out with you youve been at doctor manette s house
as much as i have or more than i have why i have been ashamed of your
morose ness there your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hang dog kind that upon my life and soul i have been ashamed of you
sydney

it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar to
be ashamed of anything returned sydney you ought to be much obliged
to me

you shall not get off in that way rejoined s try ver shouldering the
rejoinder at him no sydney its my duty to tell you and i tell you
to your face to do you good that you area devil is hill conditioned
fellow in that sort of society you area disagreeable fellow

sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made and laughed

look at me said s try ver squaring himself i have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have being more independent in circumstances
why do i do it

in ever saw you do it yet muttered carton

i do it because its politici do it on principle and look at me i
get on

you dont get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions
answered carton with a careless air i wish you would keep to that as
to me will you never understand that i am incorrigible

he asked the question with some appearance of scorn

you have no business to be incorrigible was his friends answer
delivered in no very soothing tone

i have no business to beat all that i know of said sydney carton
who is the lady

now dont let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable
sydney said mrs try ver preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make because i know you dont mean
half you say and if you meant it all it would be of no importance i
make this little preface because you once mentioned the young lady to
meins lighting terms

i did

certainly and in these chambers

sydney carton looked a this punch and looked a this complacent friend
drank his punch and looked a this complacent friend

you made mention of the young lady as a golden haired doll the young
lady is miss manette if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way sydney i might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation but you are not
you want that sense altogether therefore i am no more annoyed when i
think of the expression than i should be annoyed by a mans opinion of
a picture of mine who had no eye for pictures or of a piece of music
of mine who had no ear for music

sydney carton drank the punch at a great rated rank it by bumpers
looking a this friend

now you know all about it syd said mrs try veri dont care about
fortune she is a charming creature and i have made up my mind to
please myself on the whole i think i can afford to please myself she
will have in me a man already pretty well off and a rapidly rising man
andaman of some distinction it is a piece of good fortune for her
but she is worthy of good fortune are you astonished

carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i be
astonished

you approve

carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i not approve

well said his friends try ver you take it more easily than i fancied
you would and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would
be though to be sure you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will yes sydney i have had
enough of this style of life with no other as a change from it i
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to goto it when he doesn the can stay away and i feel
that miss manette will tell well in any station and will always dome
credit so i have made up my mind and now sydney oldboy i want to
say a word to you about your prospects you are in a bad way you
know you really are in a bad way you dont know the value of money
you live hard youll knock up one of these days and be ill and poor
you really ought to think about a nurse

the prosperous patronage with which he said it made him look twice as
big a she was and four times as offensive

now let me recommend you pursued s try ver to look it in the face
i have looked it in the face in my different way look it in the face
you in your different way marry provide somebody to take care of
you nevermind your having no enjoyment of womens society nor
understanding of it nor tact for it find out somebody find out some
respectable woman with a little property somebody in the landlady way
or lodging letting way and marry her against a rainy day thats the
kind of thing for you now think of it sydney

ill think of it said sydney




xii the fellow of delicacy


mrs try ver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the doctors daughter resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the long vacation after some mental
debating of the point he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before michael master morin the little christmas vacation between it
and hilary

as to the strength of his case he had not a doubt about it but clearly
saw his way to the verdict argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds the only grounds ever worth taking into account it was a
plain case and had not a weak spot in i the called himself for the
plaintiff there was no getting over his evidence the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief and the jury did not even turn to
consider after trying its try ver cj was satisfied that no plainer
case could be

accordingly mrs try ver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal
proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens that failing to
ranelagh that unaccountably failing too it behoved him to present
himself in soho and there declare his noble mind

towards soho therefore mrs try ver shouldered his way from the temple
while the bloom of the long vacations infancy was still upon it
anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet
on saint dunstan s side of temple bar bursting in his full blown way
along the pavement to the jostle ment of all weaker people might have
seen how safe and strong he was

his way taking him past tell sons and he both banking at tell sons and
knowing mr lorry as the intimate friend of the manette sit entered mr
s try vers mind to enter the bank and reveal to mr lorry the brightness
of the soho horizon so he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat stumbled down the two steps got past the two ancient
cashiers and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr
lorry sat at great books ruled for figures with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too and everything
under the clouds were a sum

hallo a said mrs try ver how do you do i hope you are well

it was s try vers grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place or space he was so much too big for tell sons that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance as though he
squeezed them against the wall the house itself magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far off perspective lowered displeased as if
the s try ver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat

the discreet mr lorry said in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances how do you do mrs try ver how do
you do sir and shook hands there was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands always to be seen in any clerk at tell sons who shook
hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air he shook in a
self ab negating way as one who shook for tells on and co

can i do anything for you mrs try ver asked mr lorry in his
business character

why no thankyou this is a private visit to yourself mr lorry i
have come for a private word

oh indeed said mr lorry bending down his ear while his eye strayed
to the house a far off

i am going said mrs try ver leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk whereupon although it was a large double one there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him i am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend miss manette mr lorry

oh dear me cried mr lorry rubbing his chin and looking a this
visitor dubiously

oh dear me sir repeated s try ver drawing back oh dear you sir
what may your meaning be mr lorry

my meaning answered the man of business is of course friendly and
appreciative and that it does you the greatest credit and in short
my meaning is everything you could desire but really you know mr
s try ver mr lorry paused and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner as if he were compelled against his will to add internally
you know there really is so much too much of you

wells aids try ver slapping the desk with his contentious hand
opening his eyes wider and taking along breath if i understand you
mr lorry ill be hanged

mr lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end and bit the feather of a pen

dn it all sirs aids try ver staring at him am i not eligible

oh dear yes yes oh yes you re eligible said mr lorry if you say
eligible you are eligible

am i not prosperous asked s try ver

oh if you come to prosperous you are prosperous said mr lorry

and advancing

if you come to advancing you know said mr lorry delighted to be
able to make another admission nobody can doubt that

then what on earth is your meaning mr lorry demanded s try ver
perceptibly crestfallen

well i were you going there now asked mr lorry

straight said s try ver with a plump of his fist on the desk

then i think i wouldnt if i was you

why said s try ver no will put you in a corner forensically
shaking a forefinger at him you area man of business and bound to
have a reason state your reason why wouldnt you go

because said mr lorry i wouldnt go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that i should succeed

dn me cried s try ver but this beats everything

mr lorry glanced at the distant house and glanced at the angry
s try ver

here saman of business a man of years a man of experience in
a banks aids try ver and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success he says theres no reason at all says it with his
head on mrs try ver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off

when is peak of success is peak of success with the young lady and
when is peak of causes and reasons to make success probable is peak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady the young
lady my good sir said mr lorry mildly tapping the s try ver arm the
young lady the young lady goes before all

then you mean to tell me mr lorry said s try ver squaring his
elbows that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing fool

not exactly so i mean to tell you mrs try ver said mr lorry
reddening that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips and that if i knew any man which i hope i do not whose
taste was so coarse and whose temper was so overbearing that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk not even tell sons should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind

the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mrs try vers
blood vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry
mr lorry s veins methodical as their courses could usually be were in
no better state now it was his turn

that is what i mean to tell you sir said mr lorry pray let there
be no mistake about it

mrs try ver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it which probably gave him the
toothache he broke the awkward silence by saying

this is something new to me mr lorry you deliberately advise me not
to go up to soho and offer myself myself s try ver of the kings bench
bar

do you ask me for my advice mrs try ver

yes i do

very good then i give it and you have repeated it correctly

and all i can say of it is laughed s try ver with a vexed laugh that
this haha beats everything past present and to come

now understand me pursued mr lorry as a man of business i am
not justified in saying anything about this matter for as a man of
business i know nothing of it but as an old fellow who has carried
miss manette in his arms who is the trusted friend of miss manette and
of her father too and who has a great affection for them both i have
spoken the confidence is not of my seeking recollect now you think i
may not be right

not is aids try ver whistling icant undertake to find third
parties in commonsense i can only find it for myself i suppose sense
in certain quarters you suppose mincing bread and butter nonsense its
new to me but you are right i daresay

what i suppose mrs try veri claim to characterise for myself and
understand me sir said mr lorry quickly flushing again i
will not not even at tell sons have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing

there i beg your pardons aids try ver

granted thankyou well mrs try veri was about to say it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken it might be painful to doctor
manette to have the task of being explicit with you it might be very
painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you you
know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family if you please committing you in no way representing you
in no way i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it if you should then be dissatisfied with it you can but test its
soundness for yourself if on the other hand you should be satisfied
with it and it should be what it now is it may spare all sides what is
best spared what do you say

how long would you keep me in town

oh it is only a question of a few hours i could goto soho in the
evening and come to your chambers afterwards

then i say yes said s try veri wont go up there now i am not so
hot upon it as that comes to i say yes and i shall expect you to look
in tonight goodmorning

then mrs try ver turned and burst out of the bank causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through that to standup against it
bowing behind the two counters required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing and were popularly
believed when they had bowed a customer out still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in

the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty unprepared a she was for the large pill he had to
swallow he got it down and now said mrs try ver shaking his
forensic forefinger at the temple in general when it was down my way
out of this is to put you all in the wrong

it was abit of the art of an old bailey tactician in which he found
great relief you shall not put me in the wrong young lady said mr
s try ver ill do that for you

accordingly when mr lorry called that night as late a steno clock
mrs try ver among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose seemed to have nothing lesson his mind than the subject of
the morning he even showed surprise when he saw mr lorry and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state

well said that good natured emissary after a full half hour of
boot less attempts to bring him round to the question i have been to
soho

to soho repeated mrs try ver coldly oh to be sure what am i
thinking of

and i have no doubt said mr lorry that i was right in the
conversation we had my opinion is confirmed and i reiterate my
advice

i assure you returned mrs try ver in the friendliest way that i
am sorry for it on your account and sorry for it on the poor fathers
account i know this must always be a sore subject with the family let
us say no more about it

i dont understand you said mr lorry

i daresay not rejoined s try ver nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way no matter no matter

but it does matter mr lorry urged

no it doesnt i assure you it doesnt having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition i am well out of my mistake and no harm is
done young women have committed similar follies often before and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before in an unselfish
aspect i am sorry that the thing is dropped because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view in a selfish aspect i am
glad that the thing has dropped because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view it is hardly necessary to say i could
have gained nothing by it there is no harm at all done i have not
proposed to the young lady and between ourselves i am by no means
certain on reflection that i ever should have committed myself to
that extent mr lorry you can not control the mincing vanities and
giddiness es of empty headed girls you must not expect to do it or you
will always be disappointed now pray say no more about it i tell you
i regret it on account of others but i am satisfied on my own account
and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you
and forgiving me your advice you know the young lady better than i do
you were right it never would have done

mr lorry was so taken a back that he looked quite stupidly at mr
s try ver shouldering him towards the door with an appearance of
showering generosity forbearance and goodwill on his erring head
make the best of it my dear sirs aids try ver say no more about it
thankyou again for allowing me to sound you goodnight

mr lorry was out in the night before he knew where he was mrs try ver
was lying back on his sofa winking a this ceiling




xiii the fellow of no delicacy


if sydney car to never shone anywhere he certainly never shone in the
house of doctor manette he had been there often during a whole year
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there when he
cared to talk he talked well but the cloud of caring for nothing
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness was very rarely
pierced by the light within him

and ye the did care something for the streets that environ ed that house
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief removed beauties of architecture
inspires of churches and lofty buildings as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things else forgotten and unattainable
into his mind of late the neglected bed in the temple court had known
him more scantily than ever and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes he had got up again and haunted that
neighbourhood

on a day in august when mrs try ver after notifying to his jackal
that he had thought better of that marrying matter had carried his
delicacy into devonshire and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst of health
for the sick lie stand of youth for the oldest sydney s feet still trod
those stones from being irresolute and purposeless his feet became
animated by an intention and in the working out of that intention
they took him to the doctors door

he was shown upstairs and found lucie at her work alone she had
never been quite a there as e with him and received him with some little
embarrassment a she seated himself near her table but looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few commonplaces she observed
a change in it

i fear you are not well mr carton

no but the life i lead miss manette is not conducive to health what
is to be expected of or by such profligate s

is it not forgive me i have begun the question on my lips a pity to
live no better life

god knows it is a shame

then why not change it

looking gently at him again she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes there were tears in his voice too a she
answered

it is too late for that i shall never be better than i amish all
sink lower and be worse

he leaned an elbow on her table and covered his eyes with his hand the
table trembled in the silence that followed

she had never seen him softened and was much distressed he knew her to
be so without looking at her and said

pray forgive me miss manette i breakdown before the knowledge of
what i want to say to you will you hear me

if it will do you any good mr carton if it would make you happier
it would make me very glad

god bless you for your sweet compassion

he unshaded his face after a little while and spoke steadily

dont be afraid to hear me dont shrink from anything i say i am like
one who died young all my life might have been

no mr cartoni am sure that the best part of it might still be i am
sure that you might be much much worthier of yourself

say of you miss manette and although i know better although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart i know better i shall never forget
it

she was pale and trembling he came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden

if it had been possible miss manette that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself flung away wasted drunken
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be he would have been
conscious this day and hour inspite of his happiness that he would
bring you to misery bring you to sorrow and repentance blight you
disgrace you pull you down with him i know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me i ask for none i am even thankful that it can not
be

without it can i not save you mr carton can i not recall
you forgive me again to a better course can i in no way repay your
confidence i know this is a confidence she modestly said after a
little hesitation and in earnest tears i know you would say this to
no one else can i turn it to no good account for yourself mr carton

he shook his head

to none no miss manette to none if you will hear me through a very
little more all you can ever do for me is done i wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul in my degradation i have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father and of this
homemade such a home by you has stirred old shadows that i thought had
died out of me since i knew you i have been troubled by a remorse that
i thought would never reproach me again and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward that i thought were silent forever i
have had unformed ideas of striving a fresh beginning a new shaking off
sloth and sensuality and fighting out the abandoned fight a dream all
a dream that ends in nothing and leaves the sleeper where he laydown
but i wish you to know that you inspired it

will nothing of it remain omr carton think again try again

no miss manette all through it i have known myself to be quite
undeserving and yeti have had the weakness and have still the
weakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me
heap of ashes that i am into fire a fire however inseparable in
its nature from myself quickening nothing lighting nothing doing no
service idly burning away

since it is my misfortune mr carton to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me

dont say that miss manette for you would have reclaimed me if
anything could you will not be the cause of my becoming worse

since the state of your mind that you describe is at all events
attributable to some influence of mine this is what i mean if i can
make it plain can i use no influence to serve you have i no power for
good with you at all

the utmost good that i am capable of now miss manette i have come
here to realise let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life
the remembrance that i opened my heart to you last of all the world
and that there was something left in meat this time which you could
deplore and pity

which i entreated you to believe again and again most fervently with
all my heart was capable of better things mr carton

entreat me to believe it no more miss manette i have proved myself
and i know better i distress you i draw fast to an end will you let
me believe when i recall this day that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast and that it lies there
alone and will be shared by no one

if that will be a consolation to you yes

not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you

mr cartons he answered after an agitated pause the secret is
yours not mine and i promise to respect it

thankyou and again god bless you

he put her hand to his lips and moved towards the door

be under no apprehension miss manette of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word i will never refer to it
again if i were dead that could not be surer than it is henceforth in
the hour of my death i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance and
shall thank and bless you for it that my last avowal of myself was made
to you and that my name and faults and miseries were gently carried
in your heart may it otherwise be light and happy

he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away and how much he everyday kept
down and perverted that lucie manette wept mournfully for him a she
stood looking back at her

be comforted he said i am not worth such feeling miss manette an
hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that is corn
but yield to will render me less worth such tears as those than any
wretch who creeps along the streets be comforted but within myself i
shall always be towards you what i am now though outwardly i shall be
what you have heretofore seen me the last supplication but one i make
to you is that you will believe this of me

i will mr carton

my last supplication of all is this and with it i will relieve
you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison and
between whom and you there is an impassable space it is useless to say
it i know but it rises out of my soul for you and for any dear to
you i would do anything if mycareer were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it i would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you try to hold
me in your mind at some quiet times as ardent and sincere in this one
thing the time will come the time will not belong incoming when new
ties will be formed about you ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you o miss manette when the little picture of a
happy fathers face looks up in yours when you see your own bright
beauty springing up a new at your feet think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life to keep a life you love beside you

he said farewell said a last god bless you and left her




xiv the honest tradesman


to the eyes of mr jeremiah cruncher sitting on his stool in
fleet street with his grisly urchin beside him avast number and
variety of objects in movement were everyday presented who could sit
upon anything in fleet street during the busy hours of the day and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions one ever tending
westward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sun
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down

with his straw in his mouth mr crunchers at watching the two streams
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream saving that jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from
tell sons side of the tides to the opposite shore brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance mr cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health and it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose that he recruited his finances as just now observed

time was when a poets at upon as tool in a public place and m used in
the sight of men mr cruncher sitting on as tool in a public place
but not being a poet m used as little as possible and looked about him

it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few and belated women few and when his affairs in general were so
un prosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs
cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when an
unusual concourse pouring down fleet street westward attracted his
attention looking that way mr cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along and that there was popular objection to this
funeral which engendered uproar

young jerry said mr cruncher turning to his offspring its a
bury in

hoo roar father cried young jerry

the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance the elder gentleman took the cry so ill that he watched
his opportunity and smote the young gentleman on the ear

what dye mean what are you hoo roaring at what do you want to con we y
to your own father you young rip this boy is a getting too many for
me said mr cruncher surveying him him and his hoo roars dont
let me hear no more of you or you shall feel some more of me dye
hear

i war nt doing no harm young jerry protested rubbing his cheek

drop it then said mr cruncher i wont have none of your no
harms get a top of that there seat and look at the crowd

his son obeyed and the crowd approached they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position the position
appeared by no means to please him however with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach deriding him making grimaces at him and
incessantly groaning and calling out yah spies tst yah a spies
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat

funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr cruncher he
always pricked up his senses and became excited when a funeral passed
tell sons naturally therefore a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly and he asked of the first man who ran against him

what is it brother whats it about

i dont know said the man spies yah at st spies

he asked another man who is it

i dont know returned the man clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless and voc if e rating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour spies ya hats tts tsp i ies

at length a person better informed on the merits of the case tumbled
against him and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one roger cly

was he a spy asked mr cruncher

old bailey spy returned his informant ya hats ty a hold bailey
spii ies

why to be sure exclaimed jerry recalling the trial at which he had
assisted ive seen him dead is he

dead as mutton returned the other and cant be too dead have em
out there spies pull em out there spies

the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have em out and to pull em out mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to as top on the crowds opening the coach
doors the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
for a moment but he was so alert and made such good use of his time
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye street after
shedding his cloak hat long hat band white pocket handkerchief and
other symbolical tears

these the people to re to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shutup their shops for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing practical suggestions being
much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tell sons in the further corner of the mourning
coach

the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies but the river being alarmingly near and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief
the remodelled procession started with a chimney sweep driving the
hearse advised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under
close inspection for the purpose and with a pieman also attended
by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach a bear leader a
popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional
ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand and his
bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked

thus with beer drinking pipe smoking song roaring and infinite
carica turing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting
at every step and all the shops shutting up before it its destination
was the old church of saint pancras far off in the fields it got there
in course of time insisted on pouring into the burial ground finally
accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way and
highly to its own satisfaction

the deadman disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter
genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passersby as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them chase
was given to some scores of in offensive persons who had never been near
the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated the transition to the sport of
window breaking and thence to the plundering of public houses was easy
and natural at last after several hours when sundry summerhouses had
been pulled down and some area railings had been torn up to arm
the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the guards were
coming before this rumour the crowd gradually melted away and perhaps
the guards came and perhaps they never came and this was the usual
progress of a mob

mr cruncher did not assist at the closing sports but had remained
behind in the churchyard to confer and condo le with the undertakers
the place had a soothing influence on him he procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public house and smoked it looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot

jerry said mr cruncher a post rop his ing himself in his usual way
you see that there cly that day and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young un and a straight made un

having smoked his pipe out and ruminated a little longer he turned
himself about that he might appear before the hour of closing on his
station at tell sons whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver or whether his general health had been previously at all
a miss or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man is not so much to the purpose as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser a distinguished surgeon on his wayback

young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest and reported no
job in his absence the bank closed the ancient clerks came out the
usual watch was set and mr cruncher and his son went home to tea

now i tell you where it is said mr cruncher to his wife on
entering if as a honest tradesman my went urs goes wrong tonight i
shall make sure that youve been praying again me and i shall work you
for it just the same as if i seen you do it

the dejected mrs crunchers hook her head

why your eat it afore my face said mr cruncher with signs of
angry apprehension

i am saying nothing

well then dont meditate nothing you might as well flop as meditate
you may as well go again me one way as another drop it altogether

yes jerry

yes jerry repeated mr cruncher sitting down to tea a hit is
yes jerry thats about it you may say yes jerry

mr cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroboration s
but made use of them as people not unfrequently do to express general
ironical dissatisfaction

you and your yes jerry said mr cruncher taking a bite out of his
bread and butter and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer a hi think so i believe you

you are going out tonight asked his decent wife when he took
another bite

yes i am

may i go with you father asked his son briskly

no you may n tim a going as your mother knows a fishing thats
where im going to going a fishing

your fishing rod gets ray the r rusty dont it father

never you mind

shall you bring any fish home father

if i dont youll have short commons tomorrow returned that
gentleman shaking his head thats questions enough for you i a int a
going out till youve been long a bed

he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on mrs cruncher and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage with this view he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complain the could bring against her rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections the devout est
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife it was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story

and mind you said mr cruncher no games tomorrow if i as a
honest tradesman succeed in providing aj inte of meat or two none
of your not touching of it and sticking to bread if i as a honest
tradesman am able to provide a little beer none of your declaring
on water when you goto rome do as rome does rome will be a ugly
customer to you if you dont im your rome you know

then he began grumbling again

with your flying into the face of your own witt les and drink i dont
know how scarce you may nt make the witt les and drink hereby your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct look at your boy he is
your na in the he sas thin as a lath do you call yourself am other
and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boy out

this touched young jerry on a tender place who adjure d his mother to
perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglected above
all things to laye special stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affecting ly and delicately indicated by his other parent

thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family until young jerry
was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similar injunctions
obeyed them mr cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes and did not startup on his excursion until nearly one
oclock towards that small and ghostly hour he rose up from his chair
took a key out of his pocket opened a locked cupboard and brought
forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other
fishing tackle of that nature disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs cruncher
extinguished the light and went out

young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed was not long after his father undercover of the darkness he
followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the
court followed out into the street she was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the
door stood ajar all night

impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to house fronts
walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his
honoured parent in view the honoured parent steering northward had not
gone far when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton and
the two trudged on together

within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the
winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a
lonely road another fisherman was picked up here and that so silently
that if young jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split
himself into two

the three went on and young jerry went on until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road upon the top of the bank was a low
brickwall surmounted by an iron railing in the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which
the wall there risen to some eight or ten feet high formed one side
crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that
young jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an irongate
he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the
third they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay
there a little listening perhaps then they moved away on their hands
and knees

it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate which he did
holding his breath crouching down again in a corner there and looking
in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass
and all the gravestones in the churchyard it was a large churchyard
that they were in looking on like ghosts in white while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant they did not
creep far before they stopped and stood upright and then they began to
fish

they fished with a spade at first presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew
whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off
with his hair as stiff as his fathers

but his long cherished desire to know more about these matters not
only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again they
were still fishing persevering ly when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time but now they seemed to have got a bite there was a
screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were
strained as if by a weight by slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it and came to the surface young jerry very well knew what
it would be but when he saw it and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open he was so frightened being new to the sight that he
made off again and never stopped until he had run a mile or more

he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath
it being a spectral sort of race that her an and one highly desirable
to get to the end of he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him and pictured a shopping on behind him bolt
upright upon its narrow end always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on a this side perhaps taking his arm it was a pursuer to
shun it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too for while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a drops ical boys kite without tail and wings it hid in doorways
too rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them up
to it sears as if it were laughing it got into shadows on the road
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up all this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead and even then
it would not leave him but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair scrambled into bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on
his breast when he fell asleep

from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father in the
family room something had gone wrong with him atleast so young jerry
inferred from the circumstance of his holding mrs cruncher by the
ears and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of the
bed

it old you i would said mr cruncher and i did

jerry jerry jerry his wife implored

you oppose yourself to the profit of the business said jerry and me
and my partners suffer you was to honour and obey why the devil dont
you

i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested with tears

is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wit al subject of his business

you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry

its enough for you retorted mr cruncher to be the wife of a
honest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didnt a honouring and obeying
wife would le this trade alone altogether call yourself a religious
woman if your ea religious woman give me air religious one you have
no more natra l sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has
of a pile and similarly it must be knocked into you

the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminated in
the honest tradesman s kicking off his clay soiled boots and lying down
a this length on the floor after taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay
down too and fell asleep again

there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else mr
cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an iron pot lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs cruncher in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace he was brushed
and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling

young jerry walking with the stool under his arma this fathers side
along sunny and crowded fleet street was a very different young jerry
from him of the previous night running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer his cunning was fresh with the day
and his qualms were gone with the night in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had com peers in fleet street and the city of london
that fine morning

father said young jerry as they walked along taking care to keep
at arms length and to have the stool well between them whats a
resurrection man

mr cruncher came to as top on the pavement before he answered how
should i know

i thought you knowed everything father said the artless boy

hem well returned mr cruncher going on again and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play hesa tradesman

whats his goods father asked the brisk young jerry

his goods said mr cruncher after turning it over in his mind is a
branch of scientific goods

persons bodies a int it father asked the lively boy

i believe it is something of that sort said mr cruncher

oh father i should so like to be a resurrection man when im quite
growed up

mr cruncher was soothed but shook his head in a dubious and moral way
it depends upon how you de we lop your talents be careful to de we lop
your talents and never to say no more than you can help to nobody and
theres no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for as young jerry thus encouraged went on a few yards in advance
to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar mr cruncher added to
himself jerry you honest tradesman there shop e swot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you and a recompense to you for his mother




xv knitting


there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur
defarge as early as six oclock in the mornings allow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within bending over
measures of wine monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time as our wine moreover or a souring for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy no
vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur
defarge but a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark lay hidden in
the dregs of it

this had been the third morning in succession on which there had been
early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge it had begun
on monday and here was wednesday come there had been more of early
brooding than drinking for many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls these
were to the full as interested in the place however as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine and they glided from seat to seat
and from corner to corner swallowing talk in lieu of drink with greedy
looks

notwithstanding an unusual flow of company the master of the wine shop
was not visible he was not missed for nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him nobody asked for him nobody wondered to see
only madame defarge in her seat presiding over the distribution of
wine with a bowl of battered small coins before her as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come

a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine shop as they looked in
at everyplace high and low from the kings palace to the criminals
gaol games at cards languished players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
along way off

thus saint antoine in this vinous feature of his until midday it was
high noontide when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps of whom one was monsieur defarge the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap all a dust and a thirst the two entered
the wine shop their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of saint antoine fast spreading as they came along which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows yet no one had
followed them and no man spoke when they entered the wine shop though
the eyes of everyman there we returned upon them

good day gentlemen said monsieur defarge

it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue it elicited
an answering chorus of good day

it is bad weather gentlemen said defarge shaking his head

upon which everyman looked a this neighbour and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent except one man who got up and went out

my wife said defarge aloud addressing madame defarge i have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads called
jacques i met him by accident a day and half s journey out of paris
he is a goodchild this mender of roads called jacques give him to
drink my wife

a second man got up and went out madame defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called jacques who doffed his blue cap to the company
and drank in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread heat e of this between while sands at munching and drinking near
madame defarge s counter a third man got up and went out

defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine but he took less
than was given to the stranger as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast
he looked at no one present and no one now looked at him not even
madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and was at work

have you finished your repast friend he asked in due season

yes thankyou

come then you shall see the apartment that it old you you could
occupy it will suit you to a marvel

out of the wine shop into the street out of the street into a
courtyard out of the courtyard up a steep staircase out of the
staircase into a garret formerly the garret where a white haired man
sat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes

no white haired man was there now but the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine shop singly and between them and the white haired
man a far off was the one small link that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall

defarge closed the door carefully and spoke in a subdued voice

jacques one jacques two jacques three this is the witness
encountered by appointment by me jacques four he will tell you all
speak jacques five

the mender of roads blue cap in hand wiped his swarthy forehead with
it and said where shall i commence monsieur

commence was monsieur defarge s not unreasonable reply at the
commencement

i saw him then messieurs began the mender of roads a year ago this
running summer underneath the carriage of the marquis hanging by the
chain behold the manner of it i leaving my work on the road the sun
going to bed the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill he
hanging by the chain like this

again the mender of roads went through the whole performance in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during a whole year

jacques one struck in and asked if he had ever seen the man before

never answered the mender of roads recovering his perpendicular

jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then

by hist all figure said the mender of roads softly and with his
finger a this nose when monsieur the marquis demands that evening
say what is he like i make response tall as a spectre

you should have said short as a dwarf returned jacques two

but what did i know the deed was not then accomplished neither did he
confide in me observe under those circumstances even i do not
offer my testimony monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger
standing near our little fountain and says to me bring that rascal
my faith messieurs ioffer nothing

he is right there jacques murmured defarge to him who had
interrupted go on

good said the mender of roads with an air of mystery the tallman
is lost and he is sought how many months nine ten eleven

no matter the number said defarge he is well hidden but at last
he is unluckily found go on

i am again at work upon the hillside and the sun is again about to
goto be diam collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below where it is already dark when i raise my eyes and see
coming over the hill six soldiers in the midst of them is at allman
with his arms bound tied to his sides like this

with the aid of his indispensable cap here presented a man with his
elbows bound fast a this hips with cords that were knotted behind him

i stand aside messieurs by my heap of stones to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road that where any
spectacle is well worth looking at and at first as they approach i
see no more than that they are six soldiers with at allman bound and
that they are almost black to my sight except on the side of the sun
going to bed where they have a red edge messieurs also i see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road and are on the hill above it and are like the shadows of giants
also i see that they are covered with dust and that the dust moves
with them as they come tramp tramp but when they advance quite near
tomei recognise the tallman and he recognises me ah but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hillside once again as
on the evening when he and i first encountered close to the same spot

he described it as if he were there and it was evident that he saw it
vividly perhaps he had not seen much in his life

i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tallman he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me we do it and we know it with
our eyes come on says the chief of that company pointing to the
village bring him fast to his tomb and they bring him faster i
follow his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy and he is lame because he is lame and
consequently slow they drive him with their guns like this

he imitated the action of a mans being impelled forward by the
but tends of muskets

as they descend the hill like madmen running a race he falls they
laugh and pick him up again his face is bleeding and covered with dust
but he can not touch it thereupon they laugh again they bring him into
the village all the village runs to look they take him past the mill
and up to the prison all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night and swallow him like this

he opened his mouth as wide a she could and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again defarge said go on jacques

all the village pursued the mender of roads on tiptoe and in a low
voice withdraws all the village whispers by the fountain all the
village sleeps all the village dreams of that unhappy one within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag and never to come out of it
except to perish in the morning with my tools upon my shoulder eating
my morsel of black bread as i go i make a circuit by the prison on
my way to my work there i see him high up behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage bloody and dusty as last night looking through he has no
hand free to wave to me id are not call to him he regards me like a
deadman

defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another the looks of all
of them were dark repressed and revengeful as they listened to the
country mans story the manner of all of them while it was secret was
authoritative too they had the air of a rough tribunal jacques one
and two sitting on the old pallet bed each with his chin resting on
his hand and his eyes intent on the road mender jacques three equally
intent on one knee behind them with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose defarge
standing between them and the narrator whom he had stationed in the
light of the window by turns looking from him to them and from them to
him

go on jacques said defarge

he remains up there in his iron cage some days the village looks
at him by stealth for it is afraid but it always looks up from a
distance at the prison on the crag and in the evening when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain all
faces a returned towards the prison formerly they we returned towards
the posting house now they a returned towards the prison they
whisper at the fountain that although condemned to death he will not be
executed they say that petitions have been presented in paris showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child they say
that a petition has been presented to the king himself what do i know
it is possible perhaps yes perhaps no

listen then jacques number one of that name sternly interposed
know that a petition was presented to the king and queen all here
yourself excepted saw the king take it in his carriage in the street
sitting beside the queen it is defarge whom you see here who at the
hazard of his life darted out before the horses with the petition in
his hand

and once again listen jacques said the kneeling number three
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves with a
strikingly greedy air as if he hungered for something that was neither
food nor drink the guard horse and foot surrounded the petitioner
and struck him blows you hear

i hear messieurs

go on then said defarge

again on the other hand they whisper at the fountain resumed the
countryman that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot and that he will very certainly be executed they even whisper
that because he has slain monseigneur and because monseigneur was the
father of his tenants serfs what you will he will be executed as a
parricide one oldman says at the fountain that his righthand armed
with the knife will be burnt off before his face that into wounds
which will be made in his arms his breast and his legs there will be
poured boiling oil melted lead hot resin wax and sulphur finally
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses that oldman
says all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late king louis fifteen but how do i know if he lies
i am not a scholar

listen once again then jacques said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air the name of that prisoner was damien sand it was
all done in open day in the open streets of this city of paris and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion who were full of eager
attention to the last to the last jacques prolonged until nightfall
when he had lost two legs and an armand still breathed and it was
done why how old are you

thirty five said the mender of roads who looked sixty

it was done when you were more than ten years old you might have seen
it

enough said defarge with grim impatience long live the devil go
on

well some whisper this some whisper that they speak of nothing else
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune at length on sunday
night when all the village is asleep come soldiers winding down from
the prison and their guns ring on the stones of the little street
workmen dig workmen hammer soldiers laugh and singin the morning by
the fountain there is raised a gallows forty feet high poisoning the
water

the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky

all work is stopped all assemble there nobody leads the cows out
the cows are there with there stat midday the roll of drums soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night and he is in the midst
of many soldiers he is bound as before and in his mouth there is
a gag tied so with a tight string making him look almost as if he
laughed he suggested it by creasing his face with his two thumbs
from the corners of his mouth to his ears on the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife blade upwards with its point in the air he is hanged
there forty feet high and is left hanging poisoning the water

they looked at one another a she used his blue cap to wipe his face
on which the perspiration had started a fresh while here called the
spectacle

it is frightful messieurs how can the women and the children draw
water who can gossip of an evening under that shadow under it have
i said when i left the village monday evening as the sun was going to
bed and looked back from the hill the shadows truck across the church
across the mill across the prison seemed to strike across the earth
messieurs to where the sky rests upon it

the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers a she looked at the other
three and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him

thats all messieurs i left at sunset as i had been warned to do
and i walked on that night and half next day until i met as i was
warned i should this comrade with him i came on now riding and now
walking through the rest of yesterday and through last night and here
you see me

after a gloomy silence the first jacques said good you have acted
and recounted faithfully will you wait for usa little outside the
door

very willingly said the mender of roads whom defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned

the three had risen and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret

how say you jacques demanded number one to be registered

to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge

magnificent croaked the man with the craving

the chateau and all the race inquired the first

the chateau and all the race returned defarge extermination

the hungry man repeated in a rapturous croak magnificent and began
gnawing another finger

are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register without doubt it is
safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it but shall we always
be able to decipher it or i ought to say will she

jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would not lose
a word of it not a syllable of it knitted in her own stitches and her
own symbols it will always be as plain to her as the sun confide in
madame defarge it would be easier for the weakest pol troon that lives
to erase himself from existence than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge

there was a murmur of confidence and approval and then the man who
hungered asked is this rustic to be sent back soon i hope so he is
very simple is he not a little dangerous

he knows nothing said defarge atleast nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height i charge myself
with him let him remain with me i will take care of him and set him
on his road he wishes to see the fine world the king the queen and
court let him see the mon sunday

what exclaimed the hungry man staring is it a good sign that he
wishes to see royalty and nobility

jacques said defarge judiciously show a cat milk if you wish her
to thirst for it judiciously show a dog his natural prey if you wish
him to bring it down one day

nothing more was said and the mender of roads being found already
dozing on the top most stair was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet bed and take some res the needed no persuasion and was soon
asleep

worse quarters than defarge swine shop could easily have been found
in paris for a provincial slave of that degree saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted his life was very
new and agreeable but madame sat all day at her counter so expressly
unconscious of him and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her for he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victims he would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out

therefore when sunday came the mender of roads was not enchanted
though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to versailles it was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there in a public conveyance it was
additionally disconcerting yet to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the king and queen

you work hard madame said a man near her

yes answered madame defarge i have a good deal to do

what do you make madame

many things

for instance

for instance returned madame defarge composedly shrouds

the man moved a little further away as soon a she could and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap feeling it mightily close
and oppressive if he needed a king and queen to restore him he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand for soon the large faced king
and the fair faced queen came in their golden coach attended by the
shining bullseye of their court a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes the mender of roads bathed himself so much to his temporary
intoxication that he cried long live the king long live the queen
long live everybody and everything as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous jacques in his time then there were gardens courtyards
terraces fountains green banks more king and queen more bullseye
more lords and ladies more long live they all until he absolutely wept
with sentiment during the whole of this scene which lasted some three
hours he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company
and throughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces

bravo said defarge clapping him on the back when it was over like a
patron you area good boy

the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations but no

you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear you make
these fools believe that it will last forever then they are the more
insolent and it is the nearer ended

hey cried the mender of roads reflectively thats true

these fools know nothing while they despise your breath and would
stop it forever and ever in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs they only know what your breath
tells them let it deceive them then a little longer it can not
deceive them too much

madame defarge looked supercilious ly at the client and nodded in
confirmation

as to you said she you would shout and shed tears for anything if
it made a show and a noise say would you not

truly madame i think so for the moment

if you were shown a great heap of dolls and were setup on them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage you would
pick out the richest and gayest say would you not

truly yes madame

yes and if you were shown a flock of birds unable to fly and were
setup on them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage
you would setup on the birds of the finest feathers would you not

it is true madame

you have seen both dolls and birds today said madame defarge with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent
now go home




xvi still knitting


madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to
the whispering trees such ample leisure had the stone faces now
for listening to the trees and to the fountain that the few village
scarecrows who in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn strayed with insight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered a rumour just lived in the
village had a faint and bare existence there as its people had that
when the knife struck home the faces changed from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain also that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain they changed again and bore a cruel
look of being avenged which they would henceforth bear forever in the
stone face over the great window of the bedchamber where the murder
was done two fined ints were pointed out in the sculptured nose which
everybody recognised and which nobody had seen of old and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute before they all
started away among the moss and leaves like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there

chateau and hut stone face and dangling figure the red stain on the
stone floor and the pure water in the village well thousands of acres
of land a whole province of france all france itself lay under the
nightsky concentrated into a faint hair breadth line so does a whole
world with all its greatness es and little nesses lie in a twinkling
star and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition so sublime r intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours every thought and act every
vice and virtue of every responsible creature on it

the defarge s husband and wife came lumbering under the starlight
in their public vehicle to that gate of paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended there was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry monsieur defarge alighted knowing one or two
of the soldiery there and one of the police the latter he was intimate
with and affectionately embraced

when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarge sin his duskywing s
and they having finally alighted near the saints boundaries were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets madame defarge spoke to her husband

say then my friend what did jacques of the police tell the e

very little tonight but all he knows there is another spy
commissioned for our quarter there maybe many more for all that he
can say but he knows of one

eh well said madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air it is necessary to register him how do they call that
man

he is english

so much the better his name

bars ad said defarge making it french by pronunciation but he had
been so careful to get it accurately that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness

bars ad repeated madame good christian name

john

john bars ad repeated madame after murmuring it once to herself
good his appearance is it known

age about forty years height about five feet nine black hair
complexion dark generally rather handsome visage eyes dark face
thin long and sallow nose aquiline but not straight having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek expression therefore
sinister

eh my faith it is a portrait said madame laughing he shall be
registered tomorrow

they turned into the wine shop which was closed for it was midnight
and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence examined the
stock went through the entries in the book made other entries of
her own checked the serving man in every possible way and finally
dismissed him to bed then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief in a chain of separate knots for safekeeping through the
night all this while defarge with his pipe in his mouth walked
up and down complacently admiring but never interfering in which
condition indeed as to the business and his domestic affairs he
walked up and down through life

the night was hot and the shop close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood was ill smelling monsieur defarge s olfactory sense was
by no means delicate but the stock of wines melt much stronger than
it ever tasted and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed he
whiffed the compound of scents away a she put down his smoked out pipe

you are fatigued said madame raising her glance as she knotted the
money there are only the usual odours

i am a little tired her husband acknowledged

you area little depressed too said madame whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts but they had had a ray or two for
him oh the men the men

but my dear began defarge

but my dear repeated madame nodding firmly but my dear you are
faint of heart tonight my dear

well then said defarge as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast it is along time

it is along time repeated his wife and when is it not along time
vengeance and retribution require along time it is the rule

it does not take along time to strike a man with lightning said
defarge

how long demanded madame composedly does it take to make and store
the lightning tell me

defarge raised his head thoughtfully as if there were something in that
too

it does not take along time said madame for an earthquake to
swallow a town eh well tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake

along time i suppose said defarge

but when it is ready it takes place and grinds to pieces everything
before it in the meantime it is always preparing though it is not
seen or heard that is your consolation keep it

she tied ak not with flashing eyes as if it throttle dafoe

i tell the e said madame extending her righthand for emphasis
that although it is along time on the road it is on the road and
coming i tell the e it never retreats and never stops i tell the e it
is always advancing look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know consider the faces of all the world that we know consider
the rage and discontent to which the jac querie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour can such things last bah i mock
you

my brave wife returned defarge standing before her with his head
a little bent and his hands clasped a this back like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist i do not question all this but
it has lasted along time and it is possible you know well my wife
it is possible that it may not come during our lives

eh well how then demanded madame tying another knot as if there
were another enemy strangled

well said defarge with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug
we shall not see the triumph

we shall have helped it returned madame with her extended hand in
strong action nothing that we do is done in vain i believe with all
my soul that we shall see the triumph but even if not even if i knew
certainly not show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant and still i
would

then madame with her teeth set tied a very terrible knot indeed

hold cried defarge reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice i too my dear will stop at nothing

yes but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity to sustain you sustain yourself without that
when the time comes let loose a tiger and a devil but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained not shown yet always ready

madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her armin a serene
manner and observing that it was time to goto bed

next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine shop knitting away assiduously arose lay beside her and if she
now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air there were a few customers drinking or not
drinking standing or seated sprinkled about the day was very hot
and heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
per quisition s into all the glutinous little glasses near madame fell
dead at the bottom their decease made no impression on the other flies
out pro men a ding who looked at them in the coolest manner as if they
themselves were elephants or something as far removed until they met
the same fate curious to consider how heedless flies are perhaps they
thought as much at court that sunny summer day

a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she
felt to be a new one she laid down her knitting and began top in her
rose in her he address before she looked at the figure

it was curious the moment madame defarge took up the rose the
customers ceased talking and began gradually to dropout of the
wine shop

good day madame said the newcomer

good day monsieur

she said it aloud but added to herself as she resumed her knitting
hah good day age about forty height about five feet nine black
hair generally rather handsome visage complexion dark eyes dark
thin long and sallow face aquiline nose but not straight having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression good day one and all

have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac and a
mouthful of cool freshwater madame

madame complied with a polite air

marvellous cognac this madame

it was the first time it had ever been so complimented and madame
defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better she said
however that the cognac was flattered and took up her knitting the
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general

you knit with great skill madame

i am accustomed to it

a pretty pattern too

you think so said madame looking at him with a smile

decidedly may one ask what it is for

pastime said madame still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly

not for use

that depends i may find a use for it one day if i do well said
madame drawing a breath and nodding her head with astern kind of
coquetry ill use it

it was remarkable but the taste of saint antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to arose on the he address of madame defarge two
men had entered separately and had been about to order drink when
catching sight of that novelty they faltered made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there and went away
nor of those who had been there when this visitor entered was there
one left they had all dropped off the spy had kept his eyes open
but had be enable to detect no sign they had lounged away in a
poverty stricken purposeless accidental manner quite natural and
unimpeachable

john thought madame checking off her work as her fingers knitted
and here yes looked at the stranger stay long enough and i shall knit
bars ad before you go

you have a husband madame

i have

children

no children

business seems bad

business is very bad the people are so poor

ah the unfortunate miserable people so oppressed too as you say

as you say madame retorted correcting him and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good

pardon me certainly it was i who said so but you naturally think so
of course

i think returned madame in a high voice i and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine shop open without thinking all we
think here is how to live that is the subject we think of and
it gives us from morning tonight enough to think about without
embarrassing our heads concerning others i think for others no no

the spy who was there to pickup any crumbs he could find or make did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face but
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbow on madame
defarge s little counter and occasionally sipping his cognac

a bad business this madame of gaspard s execution ah the poor
gaspard with a sigh of great compassion

my faith returned madame coolly and lightly if people use knives
for such purposes they have to pay for i the knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was he has paid the price

i believe said the spy dropping his soft voice to at one
that invited confidence and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face i believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood touching the poor
fellow between ourselves

is there asked madame vacantly

is there not

here is my husband said madame defarge

as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door the spy saluted
him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smile good day
jacques defarge stopped short and stared at him

good day jacques the spy repeated with not quite so much
confidence or quite so easy a smile under the stare

you deceive yourself monsieur returned the keeper of the wine shop
you mistake me for another that is not my name i am ernest defarge

it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited too good
day

good day answered defarge drily

i was saying to madame with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered that they tell me there is and no wonder much sympathy
and anger in saint antoine touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard

no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head i know nothing
of it

having said i the passed behind the little counter and stood with his
hand on the back of his wifes chair looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction

the spy well used to his business did not change his unconscious
attitude but drained his little glass of cognac took as ip of fresh
water and asked for another glass of cognac madame defarge poured it
out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a little song over
it

you seem to know this quarter well that is to say better than i do
observed defarge

not at all but i hope to know it better i am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants

hah muttered defarge

the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls to me
pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name

indeed said defarge with much indifference

yes indeed when doctor manette was released you his old domestic
had the charge of him i know he was delivered to you you see i am
informed of the circumstances

such is the fact certainly said defarge he had had it conveyed
to him in an accidental touch of his wifes elbow as she knitted and
warbled that he would do best to answer but always with brevity

it was to you said the spy that his daughter came and it was
from your care that his daughter took him accompanied by an eat brown
monsieur how is he called in a little wig lorry of the bank of
tells on and company over to england

such is the fact repeated defarge

very interesting remembrances said the spy i have known doctor
manette and his daughter in england

yes said defarge

you dont hear much about them now said the spy

no said defarge

in effect madame struck in looking up from her work and her little
song we never hear about them we received the news of their safe
arrival and perhaps another letter or perhaps two but since then
they have gradually taken their road in life we ours and we have held
no correspondence

perfectly so madame replied the spy she is going to be married

going echoed madame she was pretty enough to have been married long
ago you english are cold it seems to me

oh you know i am english

i perceive your tongue is returned madame and what the tongue is i
suppose the man is

he did not take the identification as a compliment but he made the best
of it and turned it off with a laugh after sipping his cognac to the
end he added

yes miss manette is going to be married but not to an englishman to
one who like herself is french by birth and speaking of gaspard ah
poor gaspard it was cruel cruel it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis for whom gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet in other words the present
marquis but he lives unknown in england he is no marquis there he is
mr charles darnay da ulna is is the name of his mothers family

madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband do what he would behind the little counter
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe he was
troubled and his hand was not trustworthy the spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it or to record it in his mind

having made atleast this one hit whatever it might prove to be
worth and no customers coming into help him to any other mr bars ad
paid for what he had drunk and took his leave taking occasion to say
in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again for some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine the
husband and wife remained exactly a she had left them les the should
comeback

can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down a this wife
a she stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair what he has
said of ma am selle manette

a she has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a little it
is probably false but it maybe true

if it is defarge began and stopped

if it is repeated his wife

and if it does come while we live to see it triumph i hope for her
sake destiny will keep her husband out of france

her husbands destiny said madame defarge with her usual composure
will take him where he is to go and will lead him to the end that is
to end him that is all i know

but it is very strange now atleast is it not very strange said
defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it
that after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herself her
husbands name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment by
the side of that infernal dogs who has just left us

stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered
madame i have them both here of a certainty and they are both here
for their merits that is enough

she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head
either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone or saint antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance howbeit the saint took courage to lounge in very
shortly afterwards and the wine shop recovered its habitual aspect

in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turned
himself inside out and sat on doorsteps and window ledges and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts for a breath of air madame
defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group a missionary there were many like
her such as the world will do well never to breed again all the women
knitted they knitted worthless things but the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus if the bony fingers had been still
the stomachs would have been more famine pinched

but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts and as madame
defarge moved on from group to group all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with and left
behind

her husband smoked a this door looking after her with admiration a
great woman said he a strong woman a grand woman a frightfully
grand woman

darkness closed around and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard as
the womens at knitting knitting darkness encompassed them another
darkness was closing in as surely when the church bells then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france should be melted into
thundering cannon when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty
freedom and life so much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting knitting that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt where they were to sit knitting knitting
counting dropping heads




xvii one night


never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
soho than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughters at
under the planetree together never did the moonrise with a milder
radiance over great london than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree and shone upon their faces through its leaves

lucie was to be married tomorrow she had reserved this last evening
for her father and they sat alone under the planetree

you are happy my dear father

quite my child

they had said little though they had been there along time when it
was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work nor had she read to him she had employed herself in
both ways a this side under the tree many and many a time but this
time was not quite like any other and nothing could make it so

and i am very happy tonight dear father i am deeply happy in the
love that heaven has so blessed my love for charles and charles s love
for me but if my life were not to be still consecrated to you or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us even by
the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappy and
self reproachful now than i can tell you even as it is

even as it was she could not command her voice

in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face
upon his breast in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of
the sun itself is as the light called human life is at its coming and
its going

dearest dear can you tell me this last time that you feel quite
quite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine will
ever interpose between us i know it well but do you know it in your
own heart do you feel quite certain

her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed quite sure my darling more than that he
added a she tenderly kissed her my future is far brighter lucie
seen through your marriage than it could have been nay than it ever
was without it

if i could hope that my father

believe it love indeed it is so consider how natural and how plain
it is my dear that it should be so you devoted and young can not
fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be
wasted

she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his and repeated
the word

wasted my child should not be wasted struck aside from the
natural order of things for my sake your unselfishness can not entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this but only ask yourself
how could my happiness be perfect while yours was incomplete

if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quite happy
with you

he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without charles having seen him and replied

my child you did see him and it is charles if it had not been
charles it would have been another or if it had been no other i
should have been the cause and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you

it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering it gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears and she remembered it long
afterwards

see said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards the moon
i have looked at her from my prison window when i could not bear her
light i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beaten my head against
my prison walls i have looked at her in a state so dull and lethargic
that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i
could draw across her at the full and the number of perpendicular lines
with which i could intersect them he added in his inward and pondering
manner a she looked at the moon it was twenty either way i remember
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in

the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time
deepened a she dwelt upon it but there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference he only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over

i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom i had been rent whether it was alive whether it had
been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it whether it
was as on who would someday avenge his father there was a time in my
imprisonment when my desire for vengeance was unbearable whether it
was as on who would never know his fathers story who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own
will and act whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman

she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand

i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful of
me rather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me i have
cast up the years of her age year after year i have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate i have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living and in the next generation my place was a
blank

my father even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child

you lucie it is out of the consolation and restoration you have
brought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and
the moon on this last night what did i say just now

she knew nothing of you she cared nothing for you

so but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could i have imagined her as coming to me in my cell and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress i have seen her
image in the moonlight often as i now see you except that in ever held
her in my arms it stood between the little grated window and the door
but you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of

the figure was not the the image the fancy

no that was another thing it stood before my disturbed sense of
sight but it never moved the phantom that my mind pursued was another
and more real child of her outward appearance i know no more than
that she was like her mother the other had that likeness too as you
have but was not the same can you follow me lucie hardly i think
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions

his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold a she thus tried to anatomi se his old condition

in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlight
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father my picture
was in her room and i was in her prayers her life was active
cheerful useful but my poor history pervaded it all

i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my love
that was i

and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvais and
they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me when they passed
a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning walls and looked
up at its bars and spoke in whispers she could never deliver me i
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things
but then blessed with the relief of tears i fell upon my knees and
blessed her

i am that child i hope my father o my dear my dear will you bless
me as fervently tomorrow

lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have tonight
for loving you better than words can tell and thanking god for my great
happiness my thoughts when they were wildest never rose near the
happiness that i have known with you and that we have before us

he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him by and bye they went into the
house

there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr lorry there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence they had be enable to extend it
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothing more

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper they were only
three at table and miss pross made the third he regretted that charles
was not there was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away and drank to him affectionately

so the time came for him to bid lucie goodnight and they separated
but in the stillness of the third hour of the morning lucie came
downstairs again and stole into his room not free from un shaped fears
beforehand

all things however were in their places all was quiet and he lay
asleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlets he put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips to his
then leaned over him and looked at him

into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had worn but he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep a more remarkable face in its quiet
resolute and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep that night

she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be and as his
sorrows deserved then she withdrew her hand and kissed his lips once
more and went away so the sunrise came and the shadows of the leaves
of the planetree moved upon his face as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him




xviii nine days


the marriage day was shining brightly and they were ready outside the
closed door of the doctors room where he was speaking with charles
darnay they were ready to goto church the beautiful bride mr
lorry and miss pross to whom the event through a gradual process of
reconcile ment to the inevitable would have been one of absolute bliss
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should
have been the bridegroom

and so said mr lorry who could not sufficiently admire the bride
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet
pretty dress and so it was for this my sweet lucie that i brought
you across the channel such a baby lord bless me how little i thought
what i was doing how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring
on my friend mr charles

you didnt mean it remarked the matter of fact miss pross and
therefore how could you know it nonsense

really well but dont cry said the gentle mr lorry

i am not crying said miss pross you are

i my pross by this time mr lorry dared to be pleasant with her
on occasion

you were just now i saw you do it and i dont wonder at it such
a present of plate as you have made em is enough to bring tears into
anybody s eyes theres not a for kora spoon in the collection said
miss pross that i didnt cry over last night after the box came till
i couldnt see it

i am highly gratified said mr lorry though upon my honour i
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to anyone dear me this is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost dear dear dear to think that there
might have been a mrs lorry anytime these fifty years almost

not at all from miss pross

you think there never might have been a mrs lorry asked the
gentleman of that name

pooh rejoined miss pross you were a bachelor in your cradle

well observed mr lorry beam ingly adjusting his little wig that
seems probable too

and you were cutout for a bachelor pursued miss pross before you
were putin your cradle

then i think said mr lorry that i was very un handsomely dealt
with and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern enough now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist i hear them moving in the next room and miss pross and
i as two formal folks of business are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear you leave
your good father my dear in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own he shall be taken every conceivable care of during the next
fortnight while you are in warwickshire and there about seven tell sons
shall goto the wall comparatively speaking before him and when at
the fortnight send he comes to join you and your beloved husband on
your other fortnight strip in wales you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame now i hear
somebodys step coming to the door let me kiss my dear girl with an
oldfashioned bachelor blessing before somebody comes to claim his
own

for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at the
well remembered expression on the forehead and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which if such things be oldfashioned were as old as adam

the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles
darnay he was so deadly pale which had not been the case when they
went in together that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face
but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered except that to the
shrewd glance of mr lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him like a cold
wind

he gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to the chariot
which mr lorry had hired in honour of the day the rest followed in
another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange
eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling
glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of mr lorry s pockets they returned home to
breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the
door at parting

it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father
cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms take her charles she is yours

and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was
gone

the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the
preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorry
and miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted
there had struck him a poisoned blow

he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was
the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got upstairs mr lorry was reminded of defarge the
wine shopkeeper and the starlight ride

i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i
think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him
i must look in at tell sons so i will go there at once and comeback
presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine
there and all will be well

it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tell sons than to lookout of
tells on she was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the
old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus
into the doctors room she was stopped by a low sound of knocking

good god he said with a start whats that

miss pross with a terrified face was a this ea romeo me all is
lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird
he doesnt know me and is making shoes

mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the
doctors room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker a this work before and his head was bent
down and he was very busy

doctor manette my dear friend doctor manette

the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he
were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again

he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the
throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old
haggard faded surface of face had comeback to him he worked
hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted

mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by
him and asked what it was

a young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking up it
ought to have been finished long ago let it be

but doctor manette look at me

he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in
his work

you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper
occupation think dear friend

nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at
a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract
a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echo less wall or on
the air the only ray of hope that mr lorry could discover was that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind

two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as important above
all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie
the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in
conjunction with miss pros she took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a
few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been
called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post

these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept
another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best on the doctors case

in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch him
attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tell sons for the
first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same
room

he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that
attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the
window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways a she could think of that it was a free place

doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on
that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour
after mr lorry could not have seen for his life toreador write
when he put his tools as ideas useless until morning mr lorry rose
and said to him

will you go out

he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner
looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice

out

yes for a walk with me why not

he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mr
lorry though the saw a she leaned forward on his bench in the dusk
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in
some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it

miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for along
time before he laydown but when he did finally lay himself down he
fell asleep in the morning he was up be times and went straight to his
bench and to work

on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he
returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and
that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged mr lorry
to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day
at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then
present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing
a miss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long
enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr lorry s
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him

when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before

dear doctor will you go out

as before he repeated out

yes for a walk with me why not

this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the
meanwhile the doctor had removed to these at in the window and had
sat there looking down at the planetree but on mr lorry s return he
slipped away to his bench

the time went very slowly on and mr lorry shop e darkened and his
heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier everyday
the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days
seven days eight days nine days

with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time the secret was
well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first
was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on
his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in
the dusk of the ninth evening




xix an opinion


worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep a this post on the
tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night

he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had
done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the
doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench
and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading
at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which
mr lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly
studious and attentive

even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own for did no this eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed
as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the
answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there
how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor
manette s consulting room and to be debating these points outside the
doctors bedroom door in the early morning

within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering a this side if he
had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have
resolved it but he was by that time clearheaded and had none
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain

miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked
out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual
white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the
usual way and came to breakfast

so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be the only safe
advance heat first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken
place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to
the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and
counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however
he was so composedly himself that mr lorry determined to have the aid
he sought and that aid was his own

therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the
doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly

my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is
very curious to me perhaps to your better information it maybe less
so

glancing a this hands which were discoloured by his late work the
doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced
a this hands more than once

doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on the
arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray
give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all
for his daughters his daughters my dear manette

if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental
shock

yes

be explicit said the doctor spare no detail

mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded

my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock
of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings
the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down one can not say for how
long because i believe he can not calculate the time himself and there
are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered by a process that he can not trace
himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to
be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and
great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately
there has been he paused and took a deep breath as light relapse

the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration

nine days and nights

how did it show itself i infer glancing a this hands again in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock

that is the fact

now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and
collected ly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit
originally

once

and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all
respects a she was then

i think in all respects

you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse

no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her
it is known only to myself and to one other who maybe trusted

the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was
very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of
the two spoke for a little while

now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his most
considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not
possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of
intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom
i could sorely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this
relapse come about is there danger of another could are petition of it
be prevented how should are petition of it be treated how does it come
about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine
if i knew how

but i dont know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity
knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be
able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little
pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly
and teach me how to be a little more useful

doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and
mr lorry did not press him

i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort
that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite
unforeseen by its subject

was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask

very much he said it with an involuntary shudder

you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers
mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him

would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to anyone when it is on
him

i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even
believe it in some cases to be quite impossible

now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors arm again
after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this
attack

i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that
there had long been ad read lurking in his mind that those associations
would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a
particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it

would here member what took place in the relapse asked mr lorry
with natural hesitation

the doctor looked de so lately round the rooms hook his head and
answered in a low voice not at all

no was to the future hinted mr lorry

as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have
great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i
should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that
the worst was over

well well thats good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry

i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence

there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxious to
be instructed i may go on

you can not do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his
hand

to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does
he do too much

i think not it maybe the character of his mind to be always in
singular need of occupation that maybe in part natural to it in
part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy
things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery

you are sure that he is not under too great a strain

i think i am quite sure of it

my dear manette if he were overworked now

my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been a
violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight

excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment
that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder

i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with the
firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of
association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has
happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost
believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted

he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would over set the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to
be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days he knew that he must face it

the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing his throat we
will call blacksmiths work blacksmiths work we will say to put a
case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad
time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly
found a this forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him

the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and be a this foot
nervously on the ground

he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious look at
his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go

still the doctor with shaded forehead be a this foot nervously on the
ground

you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quite
understand it to be a nice question and yeti think and there he
shook his head and stopped

you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause
it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings
of this poor mans mind he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved
his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain and by substituting a she became more
practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental
torture that he has never be enable to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not
find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child

he looked like his illustration a she raised his eyes to mr lorry s
face

but may not mind i ask for information as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and
banknotes may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go
with it in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the
forge

there was another silence

you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old
companion

i would not keep it said mr lorry shaking his head for he gained
in firmness a she saw the doctor disquieted i would recommend him to
sacrifice it i only want your authority i am sure it does no good
come give me your authority like a dear goodman for his daughters
sake my dear manette

very strange to see what a struggle there was within him

in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i would not take
it away while he was present let it be removed when he is not there
let him miss his old companion after an absence

mr lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended they
passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored on the
three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence mr lorry had previously
explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and
she had no suspicions

on the night of the day on which he left the house mr lorry went into
his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross
carrying a light there with closed doors and in a mysterious and
guilty manner mr lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder for
which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure the
burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire and the tools
shoes and leather were buried in the garden so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds that mr lorry and miss pross
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible
crime




xx a plea


when the newly married pair came home the first person who appeared to
offer his congratulations was sydney carton they had not been at home
many hours when he presented himself he was not improved inhabits or
in looks or in manner but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him which was new to the observation of charles darnay

he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of
speaking to him when no one overheard

mr darnay said cartoni wish we might be friends

we are already friends i hope

you are goodenough to say so as a fashion of speech but i dont
mean any fashion of speech indeed when i say i wish we might be
friends i scarcely mean quite that either

charles darnay as was natural asked him in all good humour and
good fellowship what he did mean

upon my life said carton smiling i find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind than to convey to yours however let me try you
remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than than
usual

i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking

i remember it too the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for i
always remember them i hope it maybe taken into account one day
when all days are at an end for me dont be alarmed i am not going to
preach

i am not at all alarmed earnestness in you is anything but alarming
to me

ah said carton with a careless wave of his hand as if he waved that
away on the drunken occasion in question one of a large number as
you know i was insufferable about liking you and not liking you i
wish you would forget it

i forgot it long ago

fashion of speech again but mr darnay oblivion is not so easy to
me as you represent it to be to you i have by no means forgotten it
and a light answer does not help me to forget it

if it was a light answer returned darnay i beg your forgiveness
for it i had no other object than to turn as light thing which to my
surprise seems to trouble you too much aside i declare to you on the
faith of a gentleman that i have long dismissed it from my mind good
heaven what was there to dismiss have i had nothing more important to
remember in the great service you rendered me that day

as to the great service said cartoni am bound to avow to you when
you speak of it in that way that it was mere professional claptrap i
dont know that i cared what became of you when i rendered it mind i
say when i rendered it i am speaking of the past

you make light of the obligation returned darnay but i will not
quarrel with your light answer

genuine truth mr darnay trust me i have gone aside from my purpose
i was speaking about our being friends now you know me you know i am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men if you doubt it
asks try ver and hell tell you so

i prefer to form my own opinion without the aid of his

well at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has never done
any good and never will

i dont know that you never will

but i do and you must take my word for it well if you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow and a fellow of such in different
reputation coming and going a todd times i should ask that i might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here that i might
be regarded as an useless and i would add if it were not for the
resemblance i detected between you and mean un ornamental piece of
furniture tolerated for it sold service and taken no notice of i
doubt if i should abuse the permission it is a hundred to one if i
should avail myself of it four times in a year it would satisfy me i
daresay to know that i had it

will you try

that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have
indicated i thankyou darnay i may use that freedom with your name

i think so carton by this time

they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away within a minute
afterwards he was to all outward appearance as unsubstantial as ever

when he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross the doctor and mr lorry charles darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms and spoke of sydney car to nasa
problem of carelessness and recklessness he spoke of him in short not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw
him a she showed himself

he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own room she found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked

we are thoughtful tonight said darnay drawing his arm about her

yes dearest charles with her hands on his breast and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him we are rather thoughtful
tonight for we have something on our mind tonight

what is it my lucie

will you promise not to press one question on me if i beg you not to
ask it

will i promise what will i not promise to my love

what indeed with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him

i think charles poor mr carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him tonight

indeed my own why so

that is what you are not to ask me but i think i know he does

if you know it it is enough what would you have me do my life

i would ask you dearest to be very generous with him always and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by i would ask you to believe that
he has a hear the very very seldom reveals and that there are deep
wounds in it my dear i have seen it bleeding

it is a painful reflection to me said charles darnay quite
astounded that i should have done him any wrong in ever thought this
of him

my husband it is so i fear he is not to be reclaimed there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now but i am sure that he is capable of good things gentle things
even magnanimous things

she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours

and o my dearest love she urged clinging nearer to him laying her
head upon his breast and raising here yes to his remember how strong
we are in our happiness and how weak he is in his misery

the supplication touched him home i will always remember it dear
heart i will remember it as long as i live

he bent over the golden head and put the rosy lips to his and folded
her in his arms if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets
could have heard her innocent disclosure and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband he might have cried to the night and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time

god bless her for her sweet compassion




xxi echoing footsteps


a wonderful corner for echoes it has been remarked that corner where
the doctor lived ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband and her father and herself and herold direct ress and
companion in a life of quiet bliss lucie satin the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner listening to the echoing footsteps of
years

at first there were times though she was a perfectly happy young wife
when her work would slowly fall from her hands and here yes would be
dimmed for there was something coming in the echoes something light
a far off and scarcely audible yet that stirred her heart too much
fluttering hopes and doubts hopes of a love as yet unknown to her
doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy that new delight divided
her breast among the echoes then there would arise the sound of
footsteps a the row nearly grave and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate and who would mourn for her so much swelled to her
eyes and broke like waves

that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom then among the
advancing echoes there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words let greater echoes resound as they would the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming they came and
the shady house was sunny with a childs laugh and the divine friend of
children to whom in her trouble she had confided hers seemed to take
her child in his arms a she took the child of old and made it a sacred
joy to her

ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives and making it predominate nowhere lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds her husbands
step was strong and prosperous among them her fathers firm and equal
lo miss pross in harness of string awakening the echoes as an
unruly charger whip corrected snorting and pawing the earth under the
planetree in the garden

even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest they were not
harsh nor cruel even when golden hair like her own lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy and he said with a radiant
smile dear papa and mamma i am very sorry to leave you both and to
leave my pretty sister but i am called and i must go those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mothers cheek as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it suffer them and
forbid them not they see my fathers face of at her blessed words

thus the rustling of an angels wings got blended with the other
echoes and they were not wholly of earth but had in them that breath
of heaven sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden tomb were
mingled with them also and both were audible to lucie in a hushed
murmur like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore as
the little lucie comically studious at the task of the morning or
dressing a doll at her mothers footstool chattered in the tongues of
the two cities that were blended in her life

the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton some
half dozen times a year atmos the claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited and would sit among them through the evening a she had once
done often he never came there heated with wine and one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages

no man ever really loved a woman lost her and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind when she was a wife and am other
but her children had a strange sympathy with him an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case no echoes tell but it is so and it was so here carton
was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms
and he kept his place with her as she grew the little boy had spoken of
him almost at the last poor carton kiss him for me

mrs try ver shouldered his way through the law like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water and dragged his useful friend in
his wake like a boat to wed astern as the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight and mostly underwater so sydney had a swamped
life of it but easy and strong custom unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace made
it the life he was to lead and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lions jackal than any real jackal maybe supposed to think of
rising to be a lions try ver was rich had married a florid widow with
property and three boys who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads

these three young gentlemen mrs try ver exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in soho and had offered as pupils to
lucie s husband delicately saying hallo a here are three lumps of
bread and cheese towards your matrimonial picnic darnay the polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread and cheese had quite bloated mr
s try ver with indignation which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen by directing them to beware of the
pride of beggars like that tutor fellow he was also in the habit of
declaiming tom rss try ver over his full bodied wine on the arts
mrs darnay had once putin practice to catch him and on the
diamond cut diamond arts in himself madam which had rendered him not
to be caught some of his kings bench familiars who were occasionally
parties to the full bodied wine and the lie excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often that he believed
it himself which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence as to justify any such offenders being carried
off to some suitably retired spot and there hanged out of the way

these were among the echoes to which lucie sometimes pensive sometimes
amused and laughing listened in the echoing corner until her little
daughter was six years old how near to her heart the echoes of her
child st read came and those of her own dear fathers always active
and self possessed and those of her dear husbands need not be told
nor how the lightest echo of their united home directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste was music to her nor how there were echoes all about her sweet
in her ears of the many times her father had told hertha the found her
more devoted to him married if that could be than single and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him and asked her what is
the magic secret my darling of your being everything to all of us
as if there were only one of us yet never seeming to be hurried or to
have too much to do

but there were other echoes from a distance that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time and it was now about
little lucie s sixth birthday that they began to have an awful sound
as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising

on a night in mid july one thousands even hundred and eighty nine mr
lorry came in late from tell sons and sat himself down by lucie and
her husband in the dark window it was a hot wild night and they were
all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place

i began to think said mr lorry pushing his brown wig back that
i should have to pass the night at tell sons we have been so full of
business all day that we have not known what to do first or which way
to turn there is such an uneasiness in paris that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us our customers over there seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough there is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to england

that has a bad look said darnay

a bad look you say my dear darnay yes but we dont know what reason
there is in it people are so unreasonable some of us at tell sons are
getting old and we really cant be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion

still said darnay you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is

i know that to be sure assented mr lorry trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured and that he grumbled but i
am determined to be peevish after my long days both eration where is
manette

here he is said the doctor entering the darkroom at the moment

i am quite glad you are at home for these hurries and forebodings by
which i have been surrounded all day long have made me nervous without
reason you are not going out i hope

no i am going to play backgammon with you if you like said the
doctor

i dont think i do like if i may speak my mind i am not fit to be
pitted against you tonight is the tea board still there lucie icant
see

of course it has been kept for you

thank ye my dear the precious child is safe in bed

and sleeping soundly

thats right all safe and well i dont know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here thank god but i have been so put out
all day and i am not as young as i was my team y dear thank ye now
come and take your place in the circle and let us sit quiet and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory

not a theory it was a fancy

a fancy then my wise pet said mr lorry patting her hand they
are very numerous and very loud though are they not only hear them

headlong mad and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody s
life footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red the
footsteps raging in saint antoine a far off as the little circles at in
the dark london window

saint antoine had been that morning avast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun a tremendous
roar arose from the throat of saint antoine and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below no matter how far off

who gave them out whence they last came where they began through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked scores at a time over the
heads of the crowd like a kind of lightning no eye in the throng could
have told but muskets were being distributed so were cartridges
powder and ball bars of iron and wood knives axe spikes every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise people who
could lay hold of nothing else set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls every pulse and
heart in saint antoine was on high fever strain and at high fever heat
every living creature there held life as of no account and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it

as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centrepoint so all this raging
circled round defarge swine shop and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself
already be grime d with gunpowder and sweat issued orders issued arms
thrust this man back dragged this man forward disarmed one to arm
another laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar

keep near to me jacques three cried defarge and do you jacques
one and two separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can where is my wife

eh well here you see me said madame composed as ever but not
knitting today madame s resolute righthand was occupied with an axe
in place of the usual softer implements and in her girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife

where do you go my wife

i go said madame with you at present you shall see meat the head
of women by and bye

come then cried defarge in are sounding voice patriots and
friends we are ready the bastille

with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped
into the detested word the living sea rose wave on wave depth on
depth and overflowed the city to that point alarm bells ringing drums
beating these a raging and thundering on its new beach the attack
began

deep ditches double drawbridge massive stonewalls eight great
towers cannon muskets fire and smoke through the fire and through
the smoke in the fire and in the smoke for these a cast him up against
a cannon and on the instant he became a cannon ier defarge of the
wine shop worked like a man ful soldier two fierce hours

deep ditch single drawbridge massive stonewalls eight great towers
cannon muskets fire and smoke one drawbridge down work comrades
all work work jacques one jacques two jacques one thousand jacques
two thousand jacques five and twenty thousand in the name of all
the angels or the devils which you prefer work thus defarge of the
wine shop still a this gun which had long grown hot

to me women cried madame his wife what we can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken and to her with a shrill thirsty
cry trooping women variously armed but all armed a like in hunger and
revenge

cannon muskets fire and smoke but still the deep ditch the single
drawbridge the massive stonewalls and the eight great towers slight
displacements of the raging sea made by the falling wounded flashing
weapons blazing torches smoking waggon loads of wet straw hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions shrieks volleys
execration s bravery without stint boom smash and rattle and the
furious sounding of the living sea but still the deep ditch and the
single drawbridge and the massive stonewalls and the eight great
towers and still defarge of the wine shop a this gun grown doubly hot
by the service of four fierce hours

a white flag from within the fortress and a parley this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm nothing audible in it suddenly
these arose immeasurably wider and higher and swept defarge of the
wine shop over the lowered drawbridge past the massive stone outer
walls in among the eight great towers surrendered

so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the southsea until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the bastille there against an angle of a wall he
made a struggle to look about him jacques three was nearly a this side
madame defarge still heading some of her women was visible in the
inner distance and her knife was in her hand everywhere was tumult
exultation deafening and maniacal bewilderment astounding noise yet
furious dumb show

the prisoners

the records

the secret cells

the instruments of torture

the prisoners

of all these cries and ten thousand in coherences the prisoners was
the cry most taken up by these a that rushed in as if there were an
eternity of people as well as of time and space when the foremost
billows rolled past bearing the prison officers with them and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men a man with a greyhead who had alighted torch in his
hand separated him from there stand got him between himself and the
wall

show me the north tower said defarge quick

i will faithfully replied the man if you will come with me but
there is no one there

what is the meaning of one hundred and five north tower asked
defarge quick

the meaning monsieur

does it mean a captive or a place of captivity or do you mean that i
shall strike you dead

kill him croaked jacques three who had come closeup

monsieur it is a cell

show it me

pass this way then

jacques three with his usual craving on him and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed
held by defarge sarma she held by the turn keys their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another even then so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean in its irruption into the fortress and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases all around
outside too it beat the walls with a deep hoarse roar from which
occasionally some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray

through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages down cavernous flights of steps
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick more like dry
waterfalls than staircases defarge the turnkey and jacques three
linked hand and arm went with all the speed they could make here and
there especially at first the inundation started on them and swept by
but when they had done descending and were winding and climbing up a
tower they were alone hemmed in hereby the massive thickness of walls
and arches the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull subdued way as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing

the turnkey stopped at a low door put a key in a clashing lock swung
the door slowly open and said as they all bent their heads and passed
in

one hundred and five north tower

there was a small heavily grated unglazed window high in the wall
with a stone screen before it so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up there was a small chimney heavily barred
across a few feet within there was a heap of old feathery wood ashes
on the hearth there was as tool and table and a straw bed there were
the four blackened walls and a rusted iron ring in one of them

pass that torch slowly along these walls that i may see them said
defarge to the turnkey

the man obeyed and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes

stop look here jacques

am croaked jacques three a she read greedily

alexandre manette said defarge in his ear following the letters
with his swart forefinger deeply engrained with gunpowder and here he
wrote a poor physician and it was he without doubt who scratched
a calendar on this stone what is that in your hand a crowbar give it
me

he had still the lin stock of his gun in his own hand he made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments and turning on the worm eaten stool and
table beat them to pieces in a few blows

hold the light higher he said wrath fully to the turnkey look
among those fragments with care jacques and see here is my knife
throwing it to him rip open that bed and search the straw hold the
light higher you

with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth and
peering up the chimney struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar
and worked at their on grating across it in a few minutes some mortar
and dust came dropping down which he averted his face to avoid and
in it and in the old wood ashes and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself he groped with a
cautious touch

nothing in the wood and nothing in the straw jacques

nothing

let us collect them together in the middle of the cell so light
them you

the turnkey fired the little pile which blazed high and hot stooping
again to come out at the low arched door they left it burning and
retraced their way to the courtyard seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down until they were in the raging flood once
more

they found it surging and tossing inquest of defarge himself saint
antoine was clamorous to have its wine shopkeeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people
otherwise the governor would not be marched to the hotel deville for
judgment otherwise the governor would escape and the peoples
blood suddenly of some value after many years of worthlessness be
un avenged

in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration there was but one quite steady figure and that was a
womans see there is my husband she cried pointing him out
see defarge she stood immovable close to the grim old officer and
remained immovable close to him remained immovable close to him through
the streets as defarge and the rest bore him along remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination and began to
be struck at from behind remained immovable close to him when the
long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it that suddenly animated she put her foot
upon his neck and with her cruel knife long ready he wed off his head

the hour was come when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do saint
antoine s blood was up and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down down on the steps of the hotel deville where the
governors body laydown on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation lower
the lamp yonder cried saint antoine after glaring round for a new
means of death here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard the
swinging sentinel was posted and these a rushed on

these a of black and threatening waters and of destructive up heaving
of wave against wave whose depths were yet un fathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown the remorseless sea of turbulent ly swaying shapes
voices of vengeance and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them

but in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life there were two groups of faces each seven in number so
fixedly contrasting with the rest that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with its even faces of prisoners suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb were carried high
overhead all scared all lost all wondering and amazed as if the last
day were come and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits
other seven faces there were carried higher seven dead faces whose
drooping eyelids and half seen eyes awaited the last day impassive
faces yet with a suspended not an abolished expression on them
faces rather in a fearful pause as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes and bear witness with the bloodless lips thou didst
it

seven prisoners released seven gory heads on pikes the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time long dead of broken
hearts such and such like the loudly echoing footsteps of saint
antoine escort through the paris streets in mid july one thousands even
hundred and eighty nine now heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay
and keep these feet far out of her life for they are headlong mad
and dangerous and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at defarge swine shop door they are not easily purified when once
stained red




xxii these a still rises


haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent a she could with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations when madame
defarge sat at her counter as usual presiding over the customers
madame defarge wore no rose in her head for the great brotherhood of
spies had become even in one short week extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saints mercies the lamps across his streets had a
portentous ly elastic swing with them

madame defarge with her arms folded satin the morning light and heat
contemplating the wine shop and the street in both there were several
knots of loungers squalid and miserable but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress the ragged est nightcap awry on
the wretched est head had this crooked significance in it i know how
hard it has grown for me the wearer of this to support life in myself
but do you know how easy it has grown for me the wearer of this to
destroy life in you every lean bare arm that had been without work
before had this work always ready for it now that it could strike
the fingers of the knitting women were vicious with the experience that
they could tear there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression

madame defarge sat observing it with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women one of her
sisterhood knitted beside her the short rather plump wife of a starved
grocer and the mother of two children with al this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance

hark said the vengeance listen then who comes

as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine
quarter to the wine shop door had been suddenly fired a fast spreading
murmur came rushing along

it is defarge said madame silence patriots

defarge came in breathless pulled of fared cap he wore and looked
around him listen everywhere said madame again listen to him
defarge stood panting against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths formed outside the door all those within the wine shop had
sprung to their feet

say then my husband what is it

news from the other world

how then cried madame contemptuously the other world

does everybody here recall old foul on who told the famished people
that they might eat grass and who died and went to hell

everybody from all throats

the news is of him he is among us

among us from the universal throat again and dead

not dead he feared us so much and with reason that he caused himself
to be represented as dead and had a grand mock funeral but they have
found him alive hiding in the country and have brought him in i have
seen him but now on his way to the hotel deville a prisoner i have
said that he had reason to fear us say all had he reason

wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten if he had
never known it ye the would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry

a moment of profound silence followed defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another the vengeance stooped and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter

patriots said defarge in a determined voice are we ready

instantly madame defarge s knife was in her girdle the drum was beating
in the streets as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic and
the vengeance uttering terrific shrieks and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty furies at once was tearing from house to
house rousing the women

the men were terrible in the bloody minded anger with which they looked
from windows caught up what arms they had and came pouring down into
the streets but the women were a sight to chill the boldest from
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded from their
children from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked they ran out with streaming hair urging one
another and themselves to madness with the wildest cries and actions
villain foul on taken my sister old foul on taken my mother miscreant
foul on taken my daughter then a score of others ran into the midst of
these beating their breasts tearing their hair and screaming foul on
alive foul on who told the starving people they might eat grass foul on
who told my oldfather that he might eat grass when i had no bread
to give him foul on who told my baby it might suck grass when these
breasts were dry with wan to mother of god this foul on o heaven our
suffering hear me my dead baby and my withered father is wear on my
knees on these stones to avenge you on foul on husbands and brothers
and young men give us the blood of foul on give us the head of foul on
give us the heart of foul on give us the body and soul of foul on rend
foul on to pieces and dig him into the ground that grass may grow from
him with these cries numbers of the women lashed into blind frenzy
whirled about striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled underfoot

nevertheless not a moment was lost not a moment this foul on was at
the hotel deville and might be loosed never if saint antoine knew
his own sufferings insults and wrongs armed men and women flocked out
of the quarters of a stand drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in saint antoine s bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children

no they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where
this oldman ugly and wicked was and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets the defarge s husband and wife the vengeance
and jacques three were in the first press and at no great distance
from him in the hall

see cried madame pointing with her knife see the old villa inbound
with ropes that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back
haha that was well done let him eat it now madame put her knife
under her armand clapped her hands as at a play

the people immediately behind madame defarge explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them and those again explaining to
others and those to others the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands similarly during two or three hours of drawl
and the winnowing of many bushels of words madame defarge s frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up with marvellous quickness at
a distance the more readily because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows knew madame defarge well and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building

at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection directly down upon the old prisoners head the favour was
too much to bear in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long went to the winds and saint antoine had got
him

it was known directly to the furthest confines of the crowd defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace madame defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied the vengeance and
jacques three were not yet up with them and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the hall like birds of prey from their high
perches when the cry seemed to go up all over the city bring him
out bring him to the lamp

down and up and head foremost on the steps of the building now on
his knees now on his feet now on his back dragged and struck at
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of
action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see now a log of deadwood drawn through
a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat
might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately
screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth once he went aloft and the rope
broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope
broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and
held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the
mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of

nor was this the end of the days bad work for saint antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when
the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched another of the
peoples enemies and insult ers was coming into paris under a guard
five hundred strong in cavalry alone saint antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper seized him would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear foul on company set his head and heart on
pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolf procession
through the streets

not before dark night did the men and women comeback to the children
wailing and bread less then the miserable bakers shops were be set by
long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them
again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and
slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in
common afterwards supping at their doors

scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of
most other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children
and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and
hoped

it was almost morning when defarge swine shop parted with its last
knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in
husky tones while fastening the door

at last it is come my dear

eh well returned madame almost

saint antoine slept the defarge s slept even the vengeance slept with
her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drums was the
only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed the
vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foul on
was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint
antoine s bosom




xxiii fire rises


there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together the prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it
but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of
them knew what his men would do beyond this that it would probably not
be what he was ordered

far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation
every greenleaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything was bowed down
dejected oppressed and broken habitations fences domesticated
animals men women children and the soil that bore them all worn
out

monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national
blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose
nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought
things to this strange that creation designed expressly for
monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must
be something shortsighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it
was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite monseigneur began to runaway from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable

but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like
it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase now found in hunting the people now found in hunting
the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness no the change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of monseigneur

for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the
dust not often troubling himself to reflect that d us the was and
to d us the must return being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it in these times a she raised his eyes from his lonely labour
and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now
a frequent presence as it advanced the mender of roads would discern
without surprise that it was a shaggy haired man of almost barbarian
aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many by ways through woods

such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather
ashes at on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter a she
could get from a shower of hail

the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill
and at the prison on the crag when he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just
intelligible

how goes it jacques

all well jacques

touch then

they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones

no dinner

nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face

it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere

he took out a blackened pipe filled it light edit with flint and
steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke

touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time after observing these operations they again joined hands

tonight said the mender of roads

tonight said the man putting the pipe in his mouth

where

here

he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village

show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill

see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you go down
here and straight through the street and past the fountain

to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye
over the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountains
well

well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village

good when do you cease to work

at sunset

will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without
resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child will you
wake me

surely

the wayfarer smoked his pipe output it in his breast slipped off his
great wooden shoes and laydown on his back on the heap of stone she
was fast asleep directly

as the road mender plied his dusty labour and the hail clouds rolling
away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a redcap
now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used
his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account
the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen
redcap the rough medley dress of homespun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender
of roads with a we the traveller had travelled far and his feet were
foot sore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed
with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes a she himself was into
sores stooping down beside him the road mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips
fortified towns with their stock a des guard houses gates trenches and
draw bridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against
this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no
obstacle tending to centres all over france

the man slepton in different to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the p altering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing then
the mender of roads having go this tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village roused him

good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill

about

about good

the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village
when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed
as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there a
curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only monsieur ga belle
chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his house top
alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by and bye

the night deepened the trees environ ing the old chateau keeping its
solitary state apart moved in arising wind as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a
swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the
stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis
had slept eastwest north and south through the woods four
heavy treading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard four
lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all
was black again

but not for long presently the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous
then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front
picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches
and windows were then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter
soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the
stone faces awakened stared out of fire

a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away there was
spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur
ga belles door help ga belle help everyone the tocsin rang
impatiently but other help if that were any there was none the
mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood
with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved

the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away
through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on
the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire
removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemen officers the
chateau is on fire valuable objects maybe saved from the flames by
timely aid helphelp the officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting
of lips it must burn

as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the
village was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everything
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
monsieur ga belle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary s part the mender of roads once so submissive to
authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with
and that post horses would roast

the chateau was left to itself to flame and burnin the roaring and
raging of the conflagration a redhot wind driving straight from the
infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with the rising
and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the
two dint sin the nose became obscured an on struggled out of the smoke
again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake
and contending with the fire

the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire
scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce
figures be girt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran
dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures
trudged away eastwest north and south along the night enshrouded
roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next
destination the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and
abolishing the lawful ringer rang for joy

not only that but the village lightheaded with famine fire and
bell ringing and be thinking itself that monsieur ga belle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a small instalment
of taxes and no rent at all that ga belle had got in those latter
days became impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his
house summoned him to come forth for personal conference whereupon
monsieur ga belle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel
with himself the result of that conference was that ga belle again
withdrew himself to his house top behind his stack of chimneys this time
resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man
of re talia tive temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet and crush a manor two below

probably monsieur ga belle passed along night up there with the
distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating a this door
combined with the joy ringing for music not to mention his having an
ill omen ed lamps lung across the road before his posting house gate
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour
a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur
ga belle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the
rush candles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed
and monsieur ga belle came down bringing his life with him for that
while

within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were
other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom
the risingsun found hanging across once peaceful streets where they
had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up
in their turn but the fierce figures were steadily wending eastwest
north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned
the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it
no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate
successfully




xxiv drawn to the loadstone rock


in such risings of fire and risings of sea the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the
flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the be holders on
the shore three years of tempest were consumed three more birthdays
of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her home

many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted
in

monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and
this life together like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with
infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after
boldly reading the lords prayer backwards for a great number of years
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no
sooner beheld him in hist errors than he took to his noble heels

the shining bullseye of the court was gone or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never been a good
eye to see with had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride
sarda napa luss luxury and a moles blindness but it had dropped
out and was gone the court from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was
all gone together royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and
suspended when the last tidings came over

the august of the year one thousands even hundred and ninety two was
come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide

as was natural the headquarters and great gathering place of
monseigneur in london was tell sons bank spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be
moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most
to be relied upon came quickest again tell sons was a munificent
house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate again those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made
provident remittances to tell sons were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren to which it must be added that every newcomer
from france reported himself and his tidings at tell sons almost as
a matter of course for such variety of reasons tell sons was at that
time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this
was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous that tell sons sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran
through temple bar to read

on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sata this desk and charles
darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice the
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now
the news exchange and was filled to overflowing it was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing

but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles
darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you

i understand that i am too old said mr lorry

unsettled weather along journey uncertain means of travelling a
disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you

my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence you touch
some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it is safe
enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with as to its being a disorganised city if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
house here to our house there who knows the city and the business of
old and is in tell sons confidence as to the uncertain travelling the
long journey and the winter weather if i were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tell sons after all
these years who ought to be

i wish i were going myself said charles darnay somewhat restlessly
and like one thinking aloud

indeed you area pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimed mr
lorry you wish you were going yourself and you a frenchman born you
area wise counsellor

my dear mr lorry it is because i am a frenchman born that the
thought which i did not mean to utter here however has passed through
my mind often one can not help thinking having had some sympathy for
the miserable people and having abandoned something to them he spoke
herein his former thoughtful manner that one might be listened to
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint only last night
after you had left us when i was talking to lucie

when you were talking to lucie mr lorry repeated yes i wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie wishing you were going to
france at this timeofday

however i am not going said charles darnay with a smile it is
more to the purpose that you say you are

and i am in plain reality the truth is my dear charles mr lorry
glanced at the distant house and lowered his voice you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved the
lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people if some of our documents were seized or destroyed and they
might beat anytime you know for who can say that paris is not set
a fire today or sacked tomorrow now a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay and the burying of them or otherwise
getting of them out of harms way is within the power without loss of
precious time of scarcely anyone but myself if anyone and shall
i hang back when tell sons knows this and says this tell sons whose
bread i have eaten these sixty years because i am a little stiff about
the joints why i am a boy sir to half a dozen old c odgers here

how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit mr lorry

tut nonsense sir and my dear charles said mr lorry glancing at
the house again you are to remember that getting things out of
paris at this present time no matter what things is next to an
impossibility papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here is peak in strict confidence it is not business like to
whisper it even to you by the strangest bearers you can imagine
everyone of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair a she passed
the barriers at another time our parcels would come and go as easily
as in business like old england but now everything is stopped

and do you really go tonight

i really go tonight for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay

and do you take no one with you

allsorts of people have been proposed to me but i will have nothing
to say to any of them i intend to take jerry jerry has been my
bodyguard on sunday nights for along time past and i amused to him
nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bulldog or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master

i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness

i must say again nonsense nonsense when i have executed this little
commission i shall perhaps accept tell sons proposal to retire and
live at my ease time enough then to think about growing old

this dialogue had taken place at mr lorry s usual desk with
monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long it was too
much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee and it
was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy to talk of this
terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown as if nothing had ever been done or
omitted to be done that had led to it as if observers of the wretched
millions in france and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous had not seen it inevitably coming
years before and had not in plain words recorded what they saw such
va pouring combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself
and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth and it was
such va pouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had
already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so

among the talkers was s try ver of the kings bench bar far on his
way to state promotion and therefore loudon the theme broaching
to monseigneur his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth and doing without them and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salton the tails of the race him darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection and darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more and remaining to interpose his
word when the thing that was to be went on to shape itself out

the house approached mr lorry and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed the house laid the letter down so close to darnay
that he saw the direction the more quickly because it was his own right
name the address turned into english ran

very pressing to monsieur heretofore the marquis stev re monde of
france confided to the cares of messrs tells on and co bankers
london england

on the marriage morning doctor manette had made i this one urgent and
express request to charles darnay that the secret of this name should
be unless he the doctor dissolved the obligation kept inviolate
between them nobody else knew it to be his name his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact mr lorry could have none

no said mr lorry in reply to the house i have referred it
i think to everybody nowhere and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found

the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank there
was a general set of the current of talkers past mr lorry s desk he
held the letter out inquiringly and monseigneur looked at it in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee and monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee and this that
and the other all had something disparaging to say in french or in
english concerning the marquis who was not to be found

nephew i believe but in any case degenerate successor of the
polished marquis who was murdered said one happy to say in ever
knew him

a craven who abandoned his post said another this monseigneur had
been got out of paris legs uppermost and half suffocated in a load of
hay some years ago

infected with the new doctrines said a third eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing set himself in opposition to the last
marquis abandoned the estates when he inherited them and left them to
the ruffian herd they will recompense him now i hope a she deserves

hey cried the blatant s try ver did he though is that the sort of
fellow let us look a this infamous named n the fellow

darnay unable to restrain himself any longer touched mrs try veron
the shoulder and said

i know the fellow

do you by jupiters aids try veri am sorry for it

why

why mr darnay dye hear what he did dont ask why in these
times

but i do ask why

then i tell you again mr darnay i am sorry for it i am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions here is a fellow
who infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devil ry that
ever was known abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale and you ask me why i am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him well but ill answer you i am sorry
because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel thats
why

mindful of the secret darnay with great difficulty checked himself and
said you may not understand the gentleman

i understand how to put you in a corner mr darnay said bully
s try ver and ill do it if this fellow is a gentleman i dont
understand him you may tell him so with my compliments you may also
tell him from me that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcher ly mobi wonder he is not at the head of them but no
gentlemens aids try ver looking all round and snapping his fingers
i know something of human nature and i tell you that youll never
find a fellow like this fellow trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious proteges no gentlemen hell always show e maclean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle and sneak away

with those words and a final snap of his fingers mrs try ver
shouldered himself into fleet street amidst the general approbation of
his hearers mr lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk
in the general departure from the bank

will you take charge of the letter said mr lorry you know where to
deliver it

i do

will you undertake to explain that we suppose it to have been
addressed here on the chance of our knowing where to forward it and
that it has been here sometime

i will do so do you start for paris from here

from here at eight

i will comeback to see you off

very ill at ease with himself and with s try ver and most other men
darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple opened the
letter and read it these were its contents


prison of the abbaye paris

june monsieur heretofore the marquis

the latent uneasiness in darnay s mind was roused to vigour ous life
by this letter the peril of an old servant and a good one whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him so
reproachfully in the face that a she walked to and fro in the temple
considering what to do he almost hid his face from the passersby

he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the a version with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold
he had acted imperfectly he knew very well that in his love for lucie
his renunciation of his social place though by no means new to his own
mind had been hurried and incomplete he knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it and that he had meant to
do it and that it had never been done

the happiness of his own chosen english home the necessity of being
always actively employed the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events of the week
following made all new again he knew very well that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded not without disquiet but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance that he had watched
the times for a time of action and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by and the nobility were trooping from
france by every highway and by way and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction and their very names were blotting out
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
france that might impeach him for it

but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he had
relinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it won his own private place there and earned his own
bread monsieur ga belle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions to spare the people to give them what little
there was to give such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof for his
own safety so that it could not but appear now

this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make
that he would goto paris

yes like the mariner in the old story the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it was drawing him
to itself and he must go everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on faster and faster more and more steadily to the terrible
attraction his latent uneasiness had been that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they was not there
trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity with this uneasiness half stifled and half reproaching
him he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong upon that comparison
injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur
which had stung him bitterly and those of s try ver which above all were
coarse and galling for old reasons upon those had followed ga belles
letter the appeal of an innocent prisoner in danger of death to his
justice honour and good name

his resolution was made he must goto paris

yes the loadstone rock was drawing him and he must sail on until he
struck he knew of no rock he saw hardly any danger the intention
with which he had done what he had done even although he had left
it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert
it then that glorious vision of doing good which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
revolution that was running so fearfully wild

a she walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered that
neither lucien or her father must know of it until he was gone
lucie should be spared the pain of separation and her father always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old
should come to the knowledge of the step as a step taken and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt how much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind he did not
discuss with himself but that circumstance too had had its influence
in his course

he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to
return to tell sons and take leave of mr lorry as soon a she arrived
in paris he would present himself to this old friend but he must say
nothing of his intention now

a carriage with post horses was ready at the bank door and jerry was
booted and equipped

i have delivered that letter said charles darnay to mr lorry i
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer but
perhaps you will take a verbal one

that i will and readily said mr lorry if it is not dangerous

not at all though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye

what is his name said mr lorry with his open pocketbook in his
hand

ga belle

ga belle and what is the message to the unfortunate ga belle in prison

simply that he has received the letter and will come

anytime mentioned

he will startup on his journey tomorrow night

any person mentioned

no

he helped mr lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank into the
misty air of fleet street my love to lucie and to little lucie said
mr lorry at parting and take precious care of them till i comeback
charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled as the carriage
rolled away

that night it was the fourteenth of august he sat up late and wrote
two fervent letters one was to lucie explaining the strong obligation
he was under to goto paris and showing her at length the reasons
that he had for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there the other was to the doctor confiding lucie and
their dear child to his care and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances to both he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety immediately after his arrival

it was a hard day that day of being among them with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind it was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious
but an affectionate glance a this wife so happy and busy made him
resolute not to tell her what imp ended he had been half moved to do it
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid and
the day passed quickly early in the evening he embraced her and her
scarcely less dear namesake pretending that he would return by and bye
an imaginary engagement took him out and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets with a heavier heart

the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself now and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards i the left his
two letters with at rusty porter to be delivered half an hour before
midnight and no sooner took horse for dover and began his journey
for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of the honour of
your noble name was the poor prisoners cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart a she left all that was dear on earth behind him and
floated away for the loadstone rock

i in secret


the traveller fared slowly on his way who fared towards paris from
england in the autumn of the year one thousands even hundred and
ninety two more than enough of bad roads bad equip ages and bad
horse she would have encountered to delay him though the fallen and
unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory
but the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these every town gate and village taxing house had its band of
citizen patriots with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness who stopped all comers and goers cross questioned them
inspected their papers looked for their names in lists of their own
turned them back or sent the mon or stopped them and laid them in
hold as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or
death

a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished when charles
darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at paris whatever might be fall now he must on to his journey send
not a mean village closed upon him not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and england the universal
watchfulness so encompassed him that if he had been taken in a net
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone

this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in a day by
riding after him and taking him back riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation riding with him and keeping him in charge he had been
days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in
a little town on the high road still along way from paris

nothing but the production of the afflicted ga belles letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far his difficulty at the
guardhouse in this small place had been such that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis and he was therefore as little surprised as
a man could be to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning in the middle of the night

awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on the bed

emigrant said the functionary i am going to send you on to paris
under an escort

citizen i desire nothing more than to get to paris though i could
dispense with the escort

silence growled a redcap striking at the coverlet with the but tend
of his musket peace aristocrat

it is as the good patriot says observed the timid functionary you
are an aristocrat and must have an escort and must pay for it

i have no choice said charles darnay

choice listen to him cried the same scowling redcap as if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp iron

it is always as the good patriot says observed the functionary rise
and dress yourself emigrant

darnay complied and was taken back to the guardhouse where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleeping by
a watchfire here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he
started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning

the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri coloured
cock a des armed with national muskets and sabres who rodeo neon either
side of him

the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attached to
his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist in this state they set forthwith the sharp rain driving in their
faces clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement
and out upon the mire deep roads in this state they traversed without
change except of horses and pace all the mire deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital

they travelled in the night halting an hour or two after daybreak and
lying by until the twilight fell the escort were so wretchedly clothed
that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying
his musket very recklessly charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast for
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations
confirm able by the prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made

but when they came to the town of beauvais which they did at eventide
when the streets were filled with people he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming an ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting yard and many voices called
out loudly down with the emigrant

he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle and
resuming it as his safest place said

emigrant my friends do you not see me herein france of my own
will

you area cursed emigrant cried a farrier making at him in a
furious manner through the press hammer in hand and you area cursed
aristocrat

the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the riders
bridle at which he was evidently making and soothingly said let him
be let him be he will be judged at paris

judged repeated the farrier swinging his hammer ay and condemned
as a traitor at this the crowd roared approval

checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to the
yard the drunken patriots at composedly in his saddle looking on with
the line round his wrist darnay said as soon a she could make his
voice heard

friends you deceive yourselves or you are deceived i am not a
traitor

he lies cried the smith he is a traitor since the decree his life
is forfeit to the people his cursed life is no this own

at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd which
another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates the farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned but no
more was done

what is this decree that the smith spoke of darnay asked the
postmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yard

truly a decree for selling the property of emigrants

when passed

on the fourteenth

the day i left england

everybody says it is but one of several and that there will be
others if there are not already banishing all emigrants and
condemning all to death who return that is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own

but there are no such decrees yet

what do i know said the postmaster shrugging his shoulders there
maybe or there will be it is all the same what would you have

they rested on some straw in aloft until the middle of the night and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep after long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and
would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty or all drawn
up together singing a liberty song happily however there was sleep in
beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness jingling through the untimely cold and
wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their
way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads

daylight at last found them before the wall of paris the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it

where are the papers of this prisoner demanded a resolute looking man
in authority who was summoned out by the guard

naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him and which he had paid for

where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him
whatever are the papers of this prisoner

the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them casting his
eyes over ga belles letter the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise and looked at darnay with a close attention

he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went
into the guard room meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the
gate looking about him while in this state of suspense charles
darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots the latter far outnumbering the former and that while ingress
into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar
traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the home liest
people was very difficult a numerous medley of men and women not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue
forth but the previous identification was so strict that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off that they laydown on the
ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered
about the redcap and tricolour cockade were universal both among men
and women

when he had satin his saddle some half hour taking note of these
things darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority
who directed the guard to open the barrier then he delivered to the
escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him
to dismount he did so and the two patriots leading his tired horse
turned and rode away without entering the city

he accompanied his conductor into a guard room smelling of common wine
and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake
drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying about the
light in the guardhouse half derived from the waning oil lamps of
the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition some registers we relying open on a desk and an
officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these

citizen defarge said he to darnay s conductor a she took a slip of
paper to write on is this the emigrante vre monde

this is the man

your age ev re monde

thirty seven

married ev re monde

yes

where married

in england

without doubt where is your wife ev re monde

in england

without doubt you are consigned ev re monde to the prison of la
force

just heaven exclaimed darnay under what law and for what offence

the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment

we have new laws ev re monde and new offences since you were here he
said it with a hard smile and went on writing

i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily in response
to that written appeal of a fellow countryman which lies before you i
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay is not that
my right

emigrants have no rights ev re monde was the stolid reply the officer
wrote until he had finished read over to himself what he had written
sand edit and handed it to defarge with the words in secret

defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him the prisoner obeyed and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them

is it you said defarge in a low voice as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter of
doctor manette once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more

yes replied darnay looking at him with surprise

my name is defarge and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint
antoine possibly you have heard of me

my wife came to your house to reclaim her father yes

the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge to say
with sudden impatience in the name of that sharp female newly born
and called la guillotine why did you come to france

you heard me say why a minute ago do you not believe it is the
truth

a bad truth for you said defarge speaking with knitted brows and
looking straight before him

indeed i am lost here all here is so unprecedented so changed so
sudden and unfair that i am absolutely lost will you render me a
little help

none defarge spoke always looking straight before him

will you answer me a single question

perhaps according to its nature you can say what it is

in this prison that i am going to so unjustly shall i have some free
communication with the world outside

you will see

i am not to be buried there prejudged and without any means of
presenting my case

you will see but what then other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons before now

but never by me citizen defarge

defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in a steady
and set silence the deeper he sank into this silence the fainter hope
there was or so darnay thought of his softening in any slight degree
he therefore made haste to say

it is of the utmost importance to me you know citizen even better
than i of how much importance that i should be able to communicate to
mr lorry of tell sons bank an english gentleman who is now in paris
the simple fact without comment that i have been thrown into the
prison of la force will you cause that to be done for me

i will do defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you my duty is to
my country and the people i am the sworn servant of both against you
i will do nothing for you

charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride
was touched besides as they walked on in silence he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets the very children scarcely noticed him a few passers turned
their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat
otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going to prison was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work in one narrow dark and dirty street through which they
passed an excited orator mounted on as tool was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people of the king and the royal
family the few words that he caught from this man slips first made
it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris on the road except at
beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing the escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him

that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left england he of course knew now that
perils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster and faster
ye the of course knew now he could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days and yet his misgivings were not so dark as imagined by
the light of this later time they would appear troubled as the future
was it was the unknown future and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope the horrible massacre days and nights long which within a few
rounds of the clock was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away the sharp female newly born and
called la guillotine was hardly known to him or to the generality
of people by name the frightful deeds that were to be soon done were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers how could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind

of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruel separation
from his wife and child he foreshadowed the likelihood or the
certainty but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly with this on
his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he
arrived at the prison of la force

a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom defarge
presented the emigrante vre monde

what the devil how many more of them exclaimed the man with the
bloated face

defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation and withdrew
with his two fellow patriots

what the devil i say again exclaimed the gaoler left with his wife
how many more

the gaoler s wife being provided with no answer to the question merely
replied one must have patience my dear three turn keys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added for
the love of liberty which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion

the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for

in secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paper as
if i was not already full to bursting

he stuck the paper on a file in an ill humour and charles darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seat in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates

come said the chief at length taking up his keys come with me
emigrant

through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behind them
until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded with
prisoners of both sexes the women were seated at along table reading
and writing knitting sewing and embroidering the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs or lingering up and down the
room

in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace the newcomer recoiled from this company but the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride was their all at once rising to
receive him with every refinement of manner known to the time and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life

so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen that charles darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead ghosts all the ghost of beauty the ghost
of stateliness the ghost of elegance the ghost of pride the ghost of
frivolity the ghost of wit the ghost of youth the ghost of age all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died incoming there

it struck him motionless the gaoler standing a this side and the other
gaoler s moving about who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there with the apparitions of the coquette the young beauty and the
mature woman delicately bred that the in version of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented was heightened to its
utmost surely ghosts all surely the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades

in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address coming forward i have the
honour of giving you welcome to la force and of condo ling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us may it soon terminate
happily it would bean impertinence elsewhere but it is not so here
to ask your name and condition

charles darnay roused himself and gave the required information in
words as suitable a she could find

but i hope said the gentleman following the chief gaoler with his
eyes who moved across the room that you are not in secret

i do not understand the meaning of the term but i have heard them say
so

ah what a pity we so much regret it but take courage several
members of our society have been in secret at first and it has lasted
but a short time then he added raising his voice i grieve to inform
the society in secret

there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voices among
which the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous gave
him good wishes and encouragement he turned at the grated door to
render the thanks of his heart it closed under the gaoler sh and and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever

the wicket opened on a stone staircase leading upward when they had
ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them the gaoler opened a low black door and they passed into a
solitary cell it struck cold and damp but was not dark

yours said the gaoler

why am i confined alone

how do i know

i can buy pen ink and paper

such are not my orders you will be visited and can ask then at
present you may buy your food and nothing more

there were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress as
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the four
walls before going out a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him that this gaoler
was so unwholesome ly bloated both in face and personas to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water when the gaoler was
gone he thought in the same wandering way now am i left as if i were
dead stopping then to look down at the mattress he turned from it
with a sick feeling and thought and herein these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death

five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half five
paces by four and a half the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell
counting its measurement and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wilds well of voices added to them he made shoes he made
shoes he made shoes the prisoner counted the measurement again and
paced faster to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition
the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed there was one among
them the appearance of a lady dressed in black who was leaning in the
embr a sure of a window and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair and she looked like let us ride on again for gods sake
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake he
made shoes he made shoes he made shoes five paces by four and
a half with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind the prisoner walked faster and faster obstinately counting
and counting and the roar of the city changed to this extent that it
still rolled in like muffled drums but with the wail of voices that he
knew in the swell that rose above them




ii the grindstone


tell sons bank established in the saint germain quarter of paris was
in a wing of a large house approached by a courtyard and shutoff from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate the house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles in his own cooks dress and got across the borders a
mere beast of the chase flying from hunter she was still in his
met em psychosis no other than the same monseigneur the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strongmen
besides the cookin question

monseigneur gone and the three strongmen absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and
indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or death monseigneur s
house had been first se quest rated and then confiscated for all
things moved so fast and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of september patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
monseigneur s house and had marked it with the tricolour and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments

a place of business in london like tell sons place of business in paris
would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette
for what would staid british responsibility and respectability have
said to orange trees in boxes in a bank courtyard and even to a cupid
over the counter yet such things were tell sons had whitewashed the
cupid but he was still to be seen on the ceiling in the coolest
linen aiming a she very often does at money from morning to
night bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan in
lombard street london and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy and also of a looking glass let into the wall and
also of clerks not at all old who danced in public on the slightest
provocation yet a french tell sons could get on with these things
exceedingly well and as long as the times held together no man had
taken fright at them and drawn out his money

what money would be drawn out of tell sons henceforth and what would
lie there lost and forgotten what plate and jewels would tarnish in
tell sons hiding places while the depositors rusted in prisons
and when they should have violently perished how many accounts with
tell sons never to be balanced in this world must be carried over into
the next no man could have said that night anymore than mr jarvis
lorry could though he thought heavily of these questions he sat by
a newly lighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw or any object in the
room distorted ly reflect a shade of horror

he occupied rooms in the bank in his fidelity to the house of which
he had grown to be apart like strong root ivy it chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that all such circumstances were in different to him so that he did
his duty on the opposite side of the courtyard under a colonnade
was extensive standing for carriages where indeed some carriages
of monseigneur yet stood against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeau x and in the light of these standing out in the
openair was a large grindstone a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy
or other workshop rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects mr lorry shivered and retired to his seat by the fire he had
opened not only the glass window but the lattice blind outside it and
he had closed both again and he shivered through his frame

from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came
the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring
in it weird and unearthly as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to heaven

thank god said mr lorry clasping his hands that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town tonight may he have mercy on all
who are in danger

soon afterwards the bell at the great gate sounded and he thought
they have comeback and sat listening but there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard a she had expected and he heard the gate
clash again and all was quiet

the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the bank which a great change would naturally
awaken with such feelings roused it was well guarded and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it when his door suddenly
opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which he fell back in
amazement

lucie and her father lucie with her arms stretched out to him and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life

what is this cried mr lorry breathless and confused what is the
matter lucie manette what has happened what has brought you here
what is it

with the look fixed upon him in her paleness and wildness she panted
out in his arms imploringly o my dear friend my husband

your husband lucie

charles

what of charles

here

herein paris

has been here some days three or four i dont know how many icant
collect my thoughts an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us he was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison

the oldman uttered an irrepressible cry almost at the same moment the
bell of the great gate rang again and aloud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard

what is that noise said the doctor turning towards the window

dont look cried mr lorry dont lookout manette for your life
dont touch the blind

the doctor turned with his hand upon the fastening of the window and
said with a cool bold smile

my dear friend i have a charmed life in this city i have been
a bastille prisoner there is no patriot in paris in paris in
france who knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille would
touch me except to overwhelm me with embraces or carry me in triumph
my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier and gained us news of charles there and brought us here i
knew it would be so i knew i could help charles out of all danger i
told lucie so what is that noise his hand was again upon the window

dont look cried mr lorry absolutely desperate no lucie my
dear nor you he go this arm round her and held her dont be so
terrified my love i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm
having happened to charles that i had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place what prison is he in

la force

la force lucie my child if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life and you were always both you will compose yourself now to
do exactly as ibid you for more depends upon it than you can think or
i can say there is no help for you in any action on your part tonight
you can not possibly stir out i say this because what i must bid you
to do for charles s sake is the hardest thing to do of all you must
instantly be obedient still and quiet you must let me put you in a
room at the back here you must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes and as there are life and death in the world you must not
delay

i will be submissive to you i see in your face that you know i can do
nothing else than this i know you are true

the oldman kissed her and hurried her into his room and turned the
key then came hurrying back to the doctor and opened the window and
partly opened the blind and put his hand upon the doctors armand
looked out with him into the courtyard

looked out upon a throng of men and women not enough in number or near
enough to fill the courtyard not more than forty or fifty in all the
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate and they
had rushed into work at the grindstone it had evidently been setup
there for their purpose as in a convenient and retired spot

but such awful workers and such awful work

the grindstone had a double handle and turning at it madly were two
men whose faces as their longhair flapped back when the whirling s of
the grindstone brought their faces up were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise
false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty and all awry with
howling and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep as these ruffians turned and turned their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes now flung backward over their necks some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink and what with dropping
blood and what with dropping wine and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening stone were men stripped to the waist with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies men in allsorts of rags with the stain
upon those rags men devilishly set off with spoils of womens lace
and silk and ribbon with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through hatchets knives bayonets swords all brought to be
sharpened were all red with it some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them with strips of linen and fragments
of dress ligatures various in kind but all deep of the one colour and
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and to re away into the streets the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes eyes which any un brutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life to petrify with a well directed gun

all this was seen in a moment as the vision of a drowning manor of
any human creature at any very great pass could see a world if it
were there they drew back from the window and the doctor looked for
explanation in his friends ashy face

they are mr lorry whispered the words glancing fearfully round at
the locked room murdering the prisoners if you are sure of what you
say if you really have the power you think you have as i believe you
have make yourself known to these devils and get taken to la force it
maybe too late i dont know but let it not be a minute later

doctor manette pressed his hand hastened bareheaded out of the room
and was in the courtyard when mr lorry regained the blind

his streaming white hair his remarkable face and the impetuous
confidence of his manner a she put the weapons aside like water
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone
for a few moments there was a pause and a hurry and a murmur and
the unintelligible sound of his voice and the nmr lorry saw him
surrounded by all and in the midst of a line of twenty men long all
linked shoulder to shoulder and hand to shoulder hurried out with
cries of live the bastille prisoner help for the bastille prisoners
kindred in la force room for the bastille prisoner in front there save
the prisoner ev re monde at la force and a thousand answering shouts

he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart closed the window
and the curtain hastened to lucie and told her that her father was
assisted by the people and gone in search of her husband he found
her child and miss pross with her but it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until along time afterwards when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew

lucie had by that time fallen into a stupor on the floor a this feet
clinging to his hand miss pross had laid the child down on his own
bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge o the long long night with the moans of the poor wife and o
the long long night with no return of her father and no tidings

twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded and the
irruption was repeated and the grindstone whirled and spluttered
what is it cried lucie affrighted hush the soldiers swords are
sharpened there said mr lorry the place is national property now
and used as a kind of armoury my love

twice more in all but the last spell of work was feeble and fitful
soon afterwards the day began to dawn and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand and cautiously looked out again a man so
be smeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone and looking about him with a vacant air
shortly this worn out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of monseigneur and staggering to that gorgeous vehicle
climbed in at the door and shut himself up to take his reston its
dainty cushions

the great grindstone earth had turned when mr lorry looked out again
and the sun was red on the courtyard but the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air with a red upon it that the sun had
never given and would never takeaway




iii the shadow


one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr
lorry when business hours came round was this that he had no right to
imperil tell sons by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the bank roof his own possessions safety life he would have hazarded
for lucie and her child without a moments demur but the great trust
he held was no this own and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business

at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of finding out
the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city but the
same consideration that suggested him repudiated him he lived in the
most violent quarter and doubtless was influential there and deep in
its dangerous workings

noon coming and the doctor not returning and every minutes delay
tending to compromise tell sons mr lorry advised with lucie she said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a shortterm in that
quarter near the banking house as there was no business objection to
this and a she foresaw that even if it were all well with charles and
he were to be released he could not hope to leave the city mr lorry
went out inquest of such a lodging and found a suitable one high up
in a removed by street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes

to this lodging heat once removed lucie and her child and miss pross
giving them whatcom for the could and much more than he had himself
he left jerry with them as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head and returned to his own occupations
a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him

it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closed he
was again alone in his room of the previous night considering what to
do next when he heard a foot upon the stair in a few moments a
man stood in his presence who with a keenly observant look at him
addressed him by his name

your servant said mr lorry do you know me

he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair from forty five
to fifty years of age for answer he repeated without any change of
emphasis the words

do you know me

i have seen you somewhere

perhaps at my wine shop

much interested and agitated mr lorry said you come from doctor
manette

yes i come from doctor manette

and what says he what does he send me

defarge gave into his anxious hand an open scrap of paper it bore the
words in the doctors writing

charles is safe but i can not safely leave this place yet
i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
from charles to his wife let the bearer see his wife

it was dated from la force within an hour

will you accompany me said mr lorry joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud to where his wife resides

yes returned defarge

scarcely noticing as yet in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way defarge spoke mr lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard there they found two women one knitting

madame defarge surely said mr lorry who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago

it is she observed her husband

does madame go with us inquired mr lorry seeing that she moved as
they moved

yes that she maybe able to recognise the faces and know the persons
it is for their safety

beginning to be struck by defarge s manner mr lorry looked dubiously
at him and led the way both the women followed the second woman being
the vengeance

they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might
ascended the staircase of the new domicile were admitted by jerry
and found lucie weeping alone she was thrown into a transport by the
tidings mr lorry gave her of her husband and clasped the hand that
delivered his note little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night and might but for a chance have done to him

dearest take courage i am well and your father has
influence around me you can not answer this
kiss our child for me

that was all the writing it was so much however to her who received
it that she turned from defarge to his wife and kissed one of the
hands that knitted it was a passionate loving thankful womanly
action but the handmade no response dropped cold and heavy and took
to its knitting again

there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check she stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom and with her hands yet at her
neck looked terrified at madame defarge madame defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold impassive stare

my dear said mr lorry striking into explain there are frequent
rising sin the streets and although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times to the end that she may know them that she
may identify them i believe said mr lorry rather halting in his
reassuring words as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more i state the case citizen defarge

defarge looked gloomily a this wife and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence

you had better lucie said mr lorry doing all he could to
propitiate by tone and manner have the dear child here and our
good pros sour good pross defarge is an english lady and knows no
french

the lady in question whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner was not to be shaken by distress and danger
appeared with folded arms and observed in english to the vengeance
whom here yes first encountered well i am sure boldface i hope
you are pretty well she also bestowed a british cough on madame
defarge but neither of the two took much heed of her

is that his child said madame defarge stopping in her work for the
first time and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it
were the finger of fate

yes madame answered mr lorry this is our poor prisoners darling
daughter and only child

the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her and held her to her breast the
shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall
threatening and dark on both the mother and the child

it is enough my husband said madame defarge i have seen them we
may go

but the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it not visible and
presented but indistinct and withheld to alarm lucie into saying as
she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge s dress

you will be good to my poor husband you will do him no harm you will
help me to see him if you can

your husband is not my business here returned madame defarge looking
down at her with perfect composure it is the daughter of your father
who is my business here

for my sake then be merciful to my husband for my childs sake she
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful we are more
afraid of you than of these others

madame defarge received it as a compliment and looked at her husband
defarge who had been uneasily biting his thumbnail and looking at her
collected his face into a sterner expression

what is it that your husband says in that little letter asked madame
defarge with a lowering smile influence he says something touching
influence

that my father said lucie hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it has
much influence around him

surely it will release him said madame defarge let it do so

as a wife and mother cried lucie most earnestly i implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess against
my innocent husband but to use it in his behalf o sister woman think
of me as a wife and mother

madame defarge looked coldly as ever at the suppliant and said
turning to her friend the vengeance

the wives and mothers we have been used to see since we were as little
as this child and much less have not been greatly considered we have
known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them
often enough all our lives we have seen our sister women suffer in
themselves and in their children poverty nakedness hunger thirst
sickness misery oppression and neglect of all kinds

we have seen nothing else returned the vengeance

we have borne this along time said madame defarge turning here yes
again upon lucie judge you is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now

she resumed her knitting and went out the vengeance followed defarge
went last and closed the door

courage my dear lucie said mr lorry a she raised her courage
courage so far all goes well with us much much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls cheer up and have a thankful heart

i am not thankless i hope but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes

tutt ut said mr lorry what is this despondency in the brave
little breast a shadow indeed no substance in it lucie

but the shadow of the manner of these defarge s was dark upon himself
for all that and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly




iv calm in storm


doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her that
not until long afterwards when france and she were far apart did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain she only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered

to mr lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of la force that in the prison he had
found a self appointed tribunal sitting before which the prisoners were
brought singly and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred or to be released or in a few cases to be sent back
to their cells that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and un accused prisoner in the bastille that one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this
man was defarge

that here upon he had ascertained through the registers on the table
that his son in law was among the living prisoners and had pleaded hard
to the tribunal of whom some members were asleep and some awake some
dirty with murder and some clean some sober and some not for his life
and liberty that in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court and
examined that he seemed on the point of being at once released when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible
to the doctor which led to a few words of secret conference that
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody but should for his sake beheld
inviolate in safe custody that immediately on a signal the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again but that he the
doctor had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son in law was through no malice or mischance
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings that he had obtained the permission and
had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over

the sight she had seen there with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals shall remain untold the mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces one prisoner there was he said who had
been discharged into the street free but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike a she passed out being besought to goto him and dress
the wound the doctor had passed out at the same gate and had found him
in the arms of a company of samaritans who were seated on the bodies
of their victims with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare they had helped the healer and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot had then caught up their weapons and plunged
a new into a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands and swooned away in the midst of it

as mr lorry received these confidences and a she watched the face of
his friend now sixty two years of age a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger

but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he had never
at all known him in his present character for the first time the doctor
felt now that his suffering was strength and power for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forged their on which
could break the prison door of his daughters husband and deliver him
it all tended to a good end my friend it was not mere waste and ruin
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself i will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her by the aid
of heaven i will do it thus doctor manette and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes the resolute face the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped like a
clock for so many years and then set going again with an energy which
had la in dormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with would
have yielded before his persevering purpose while he kept himself
in his place as a physician whose business was with all degrees
of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good he used his
personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons and among them of la force he could now assure lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners he saw her husband weekly and brought sweet
messages to her straight from his lips sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her though never by the doctors hand but she was
not permitted to write to him for among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad

this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubt still the
sagacious mr lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride it was a natural and worthy one
but he observed it as a curiosity the doctor knew that up to that
time his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness
now that this was changed and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charles s
ultimate safety and deliverance he became so far exalted by the change
that he took the lead and direction and required them as the weak to
trust to him as the strong the preceding relative positions of himself
and lucie were reversed yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him all
curious to see thought mr lorry in his amiably shrewd way but all
natural and right so take the lead my dear friend and keep it it
couldnt be in better hands

but though the doctor tried hard and never ceased trying to get
charles darnay set at liberty or atleast to get him brought to trial
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him the new
era began the king was tried doomed and beheaded the republic of
liberty equality fraternity or death declared for victory or death
against the world in arms the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of notre dame three hundred thousand men summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth rose from all the varying soils
of france as if the dragons teeth had been sown broadcast and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain on rockin gravel and
alluvial mud under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of
the north in fell and forest in the vineyards and the olive grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers and in the sand of the seashore
what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year
one of liberty the deluge rising from below not falling from above
and with the windows of heaven shut not opened

there was no pause no pity no peace no interval of relenting rest no
measurement of time though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young and the evening and morning were the first day other
count of time there was none hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation as it is in the fever of one patient now breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city the executioner showed the people the
head of the king and now it seemed almost in the same breath the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery to turn it grey

and yet observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases the time was long while it flamed by so fast a
revolutionary tribunal in the capital and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land a law of the suspected
which struck away all security for liberty or life and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence and could obtain no hearing
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old
above all one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world the figure of the
sharp female called la guillotine

it was the popular theme for jests it was the best cure for headache
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion it was the national razor which
shaved close who kissed la guillotine looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack it was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race it superseded the cross models of it were worn on breasts
from which the cross was discarded and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the cross was denied

it sheared off heads so many that it and the ground it most polluted
were a rotten red it was taken to pieces like a toy puzzle for a young
devil and was put together again when the occasion wanted it it hushed
the eloquent struck down the powerful abolished the beautiful and
good twenty two friends of high public mark twentyone living and one
dead it had lopped the heads off in one morning in as many minutes
the name of the strongman of old scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it but so armed he was stronger than his
namesake and blinder and to re away the gates of gods own temple every
day

among the set errors and the brood belonging to them the doctor walked
with a steady head confident in his power cautiously persistent in his
end never doubting that he would save lucie s husband at last yet the
current of the time swept by so strong and deep and carried the time
away so fiercely that charles had la in in prison one year and three
months when the doctor was thus steady and confident so much more
wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month
that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun still the doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head no man better known than he in paris at
that day no man in a stranger situation silent humane indispensable
in hospital and prison using his art equally among assassins and
victims he was amana part in the exercise of his skill the
appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all
other men he was not suspected or brought in question anymore than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before or were
a spirit moving among mortals




v the wood sawyer


one year and three months during all that time lucie was never
sure from hour to hour but that the guillotine would strike off her
husbands head next day everyday through the stony streets the
tum bril snow jolted heavily filled with condemned lovely girls bright
women brown haired black haired and grey youths stalwart men and
old gentle born and peasant born all redwine for la guillotine all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons
and carried to her through the streets to s lake her devouring thirst
liberty equality fraternity or death the last much the easiest to
bestow o guillotine

if the suddenness of her calamity and the whirling wheels of the time
had stunned the doctors daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair it would but have been with her as it was with many but from
the hour when she had taken the whitehead to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of saint antoine she had been true to her duties she was
truest to them in the season of trial as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be

as soon as they were established in their new residence and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time little lucie she taught
as regularly as if they had all been united in their english home the
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited the little preparations for his speedy
return the setting aside of his chair and his books these and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind

she did not greatly alter in appearance the plain dark dresses akin to
mourning dresses which she and her child wore were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days she lost her colour
and the old and intent expression was a constant not an occasional
thing otherwise she remained very pretty and comely sometimes at
night on kissing her father she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day and would say that her sole reliance under heaven
was on him he always resolutely answered nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge and i know that i can save him lucie

they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks when her
father said to her on coming home one evening

my dear there is an upper window in the prison to which charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon when he can get to
it which depends on many uncertainties and incidents he might see you
in the street he thinks if you stood in a certain place that i can
show you but you will not be able to see him my poor child and even
if you could it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition

o show me the place my father and i will go there everyday

from that time in all weathers she waited there two hours as the
clocks truck two she was there and at four she turned resignedly away
when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her they
went together at other times she was alone but she never missed a
single day

it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street the hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning was the only house at that
end all else was wall on the third day of her being there he noticed
her

good day citizen ess

good day citizen

this mode of address was now prescribed by decree it had been
established voluntarily sometime ago among the more thorough patriots
but was now law for everybody

walking here again citizen ess

you see me citizen

the wood sawyer who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture he
had once been a mender of roads cast a glance at the prison pointed
at the prison and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars peeped through them jocose ly

but its not my business said he and went on sawing his wood

next day he was looking out for her and accosted her the moment she
appeared

what walking here again citizen ess

yes citizen

aha child too your mother is it not my little citizen ess

do i say yes mamma whispered little lucie drawing close to her

yes dearest

yes citizen

ah but its not my business my work is my business see my saw i
call it my little guillotine lalalala lala and off his head
comes

the billet fellas he spoke and he threw it into a basket

i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine see here again
loo loo loo loo loo loo and off her head comes now a child
tickle tickle pickle pickle and of fits head comes all the
family

lucie shuddered a she threw two more billets into his basket but it was
impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was at work and not be in
his sight thenceforth to secure his goodwill she always spoke to him
first and often gave him drink money which he readily received

he was an inquisitive fellow and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates and in lifting her heart
up to her husband she would come to herself to find him looking at her
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work but its
not my business he would generally say at those times and would
briskly fall to his sawing again

in all weathers in the snow and frost of winter in the bitter winds of
spring in the hot sunshine of summer in the rains of autumn and again
in the snow and frost of winter lucie passed two hours of everyday at
this place and everyday on leaving it she kissed the prison wall
her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in
five or six times it might be twice or thrice running it might be not
for a week or a fortnight together it was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served and on that possibility she would have
waited out the days even days a week

these occupations brought her round to the december month where in her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head on a lightly snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner it was a day of some wild
rejoicing and a festival she had seen the houses as she came along
decorated with little pikes and with little red caps stuck upon them
also with tri coloured ribbons also with the standard inscription
tri coloured letters were the favourite republic one and indivisible
liberty equality fraternity or death

the miserable shop of the wood sawyer was so small that its whole
surface furnished very in different space for this legend he had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him however who had squeezed death in
with most inappropriate difficulty on his house top he displayed pike
and cap as a good citizen must and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his little sainte guillotine for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised his shop was shut and he
was not there which was a relief to lucie and left her quite alone

but he was not far off for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along which filled her with fear a moment
afterwards and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall in the midst of whom was the wood sawyer hand in hand with
the vengeance there could not be fewer than five hundred people and
they were dancing like five thousand demons there was no other music
than their own singing they danced to the popular revolution song
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison
men and women danced together women danced together men danced
together as hazard had brought them together at first they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags but as they
filled the place and stopped to dance about lucie some ghastly
apparition of a dance figure gone raving mad arose among them they
advanced retreated struck at one another shands clutched at one
another she ads spun round alone caught one another and spun round
in pairs until many of them dropped while those were down the rest
linked hand in hand and all spun round together then the ring broke
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once began again struck clutched and to re and then
reversed the spin and all spun round another way suddenly they stopped
again paused struck out the time a fresh formed into lines the width
of the public way and with their head slowdown and their hands high
up swooped screaming off no fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance it was so emphatically a fallen sport a something once
innocent delivered over to all devil rya healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood bewildering the senses and steeling the
heart such grace as was visible in it made it the uglier showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become the maiden ly
bosom bared to this the pretty almost childs head thus distracted the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt were types of
the disjointed time

this was the car magno leas it passed leaving lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood sawyers house the feathery snow
fellas quietly and lay as white and soft as if it had never been

o my father for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand such a cruel bad sight

i know my dear i know i have seen it many times dont be
frightened not one of them would harm you

i am not frightened for myself my father but when i think of my
husband and the mercies of these people

we will set him above their mercies very soon i left him climbing to
the window and i came to tell you there is no one here to see you may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof

i do so father and is end him my soul with it

you can not see him my poor dear

no father said lucie yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand
no

a footstep in the snow madame defarge i salute you citizen ess
from the doctor i salute you citizen this in passing nothing more
madame defarge gone like a shadow over the white road

give me your arm my love pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage for his sake that was well done they had left the spot
it shall not be in vain charles is summoned for tomorrow

for tomorrow

there is no time to lose i am well prepared but there are precautions
to be taken that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the tribunal he has not received the notice yet but i know
that he will presently be summoned for tomorrow and removed to the
concierge rie i have timely information you are not afraid

she could scarcely answer i trust in you

do so implicitly your suspense is nearly ended my darling he shall
be restored to you within a few hours i have encompassed him with every
protection i must see lorry

he stopped there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing they
both knew too well what it meant one two three three tum bril s faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow

i must see lorry the doctor repeated turning her another way

the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust had never left i the
and his books were infrequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national what he could save for the owners he saved no
betterman living to holdfast by what tell sons had in keeping and to
hold his peace

a murky red and yellow sky and arising mist from the seine denoted
the approach of darkness it was almost dark when they arrived at the
bank the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted above a heap of dust and ashes in the court ran the letters
national property republic one and indivisible liberty equality
fraternity or death

who could that be with mr lorry the owner of the riding coat upon the
chair who must not be seen from whom newly arrived did he come out
agitated and surprised to take his favourite in his arms to whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words when raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued
he said removed to the concierge rie and summoned for tomorrow




vi triumph


the dread tribunal of five judges public prosecutor and determined
jurys at everyday their lists went for the very evening and were
readout by the gaoler s of the various prisons to their prisoners the
standard gaoler joke was come out and listen to the evening paper you
inside there

charles ev re monde called darnay

so at last began the evening paper at la force

when a name was called its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded charles
ev re monde called darnay had reason to know the usage he had seen
hundreds pass away so

his bloated gaoler who wore spectacles to read with glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place and went through the
list making a similar short pause at each name there were twenty three
names but only twenty were responded to for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten the list was read in the vaulted chamber
where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival everyone of those had perished in the massacre every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with had died on the
scaffold

there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was
soon over it was the incident of everyday and the society of la force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert for that evening they crowded to the grates and shed tears
there but twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled and the time was at best short to the lockup hour when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night the prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling their ways arose out of the condition of the
time similarly though with a subtle difference a species of fervour
or intoxication known without doubt to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily and to die by it was not mere
boastful ness but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind in
seasons of pestilence some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease a terrible passing inclination to die of it and all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts only needing circumstances to evoke
them

the passage to the concierge rie was short and dark the night in its
vermin haunted cells was long and cold next day fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before charles darnay s name was called all the fifteen
were condemned and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half

charles ev re monde called darnay was at length arraigned

his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats but the rough redcap
and tri coloured cockade was the he address otherwise prevailing looking
at the jury and the turbulent audience he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed and that the felons were trying the
honest men the lowest cruelest and worst populace of a city never
without its quantity of low cruel and bad were the directing
spirits of the scene noisily commenting applauding disapproving
anticipating and precipitating the result without a check of the men
the greater part were armed in various ways of the women some wore
knives some daggers some ate and drank as they looked on many
knitted among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under
her armas she worked she was in a front row by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly
remembered as defarge he noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear and that she seemed to be his wife but what he most noticed
in the two figures was that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be they never looked towards him they seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination and they looked at
the jury but at nothing else under the presidents at doctor manette
in his usual quiet dress as well as the prisoner could see he and mr
lorry were the only men there unconnected with the tribunal who
wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
car magno le

charles ev re monde called darnay was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the republic under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of death it was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to france there he was and there was
the decree he had been taken in france and his head was demanded

takeoff his head cried the audience an enemy to the republic

the president rang his bell to silence those cries and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
england

undoubtedly it was

was he not an emigrant then what did he call himself

not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law

why not the president desired to know

because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left
his country he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use to live by his own industry in
england rather than on the industry of the over laden people of france

what proof had he of this

he handed in the names of two witnesses theophile ga belle and
alexandre manette

but he had married in england the president reminded him

true but not an englishwoman

a citizen ess of france

yes by birth

her name and family

lucie manette only daughter of doctor manette the good physician who
sits there

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience cries in exaltation
of the well known good physician rent the hall so capriciously were
the people moved that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him

on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had set his foot
according to doctor manette s reiterated instructions the same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him and had prepared every
inch of his road

the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not
sooner

he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had no means
of living in france save those he had resigned whereas in england
he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature
he had returned when he did on the pressing and written entreaty of
a french citizen who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence he had comeback to save a citizens life and to bear his
testimony at whatever personal hazard to the truth was that criminal
in the eyes of the republic

the populace cried enthusiastically no and the president rang his
bell to quiet them which it did not for they continued to cry no
until they left off of their own will

the president required the name of that citizen the accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness he also referred with confidence
to the citizens letter which had been taken from him at the barrier
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the president

the doctor had taken care that it should be there had assured him that
it would be there and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read citizen ga belle was called to confirm it and did so citizen
ga belle hinted with infinite delicacy and politeness that in the
pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbaye in fact had rather passed out
of the tribunals patriotic remembrance until three days ago when he
had been summoned before it and had been set at liberty on the jurys
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered as to himself by the surrender of the citizen ev re monde
called darnay

doctor manette was next questioned his high personal popularity
and the clearness of his answers made a great impression but a she
proceeded a she showed that the accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment that the accused had remained in
england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile that so far from being in favour with the aristocrat
government there he had actually been tried for his life by it as
the foe of england and friend of the united states a she brought these
circumstances into view with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and the
populace became one at last when he appealed by name to monsieur
lorry an english gentleman then and the represent who like himself
had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his
account of it the jury declared that they had heard enough and that
they were ready with their votes if the president were content to
receive them

at every vote the jury men voted aloud and individually the populace
setup a shout of applause all the voices were in the prisoners
favour and the president declared him free

then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy or which they regarded as some set off against
their swollen account of cruel rage no man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable it is probable
to a blending of all the three with the second predominating no sooner
was the acquittal pronounced than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion nonetheless because he knew very well that the very same
people carried by another current would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets

his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried
rescued him from these caresses for the moment five were to be tried
together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed so quick was the tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost that these five came down to
him before he left the place condemned to die within twenty four
hours the first of them told him so with the customary prison sign
of death a raised finger and they all added in words long live the
republic

the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen their proceedings
for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate there was a great
crowd about it in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
court except two for which he looked in vain on his coming out the
concourse made at him a new weeping embracing and shouting all by
turns and all together until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted seemed to run mad like the people on the
shore

they put him into a great chair they had among them and which they had
taken either out of the court itself or one of its rooms or passages
over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a redcap on its top in this car of triumph not
even the doctors entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on mens shoulders with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces that
he more than once mis doubted his mind being in confusion and that he
was in the tum bril on his way to the guillotine

in wild dreamlike procession embracing whom they met and pointing
him out they carried him on reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing republican colour in winding and tramping through them as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived her father
had gone on before to prepare her and when her husband stood upon his
feet she dropped insensible in his arms

a she held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen a few of the people fell to dancing instantly all the
rest fell to dancing and the courtyard overflowed with the car magno le
then they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets and along the rivers bank
and over the bridge the car magno le absorbed them everyone and whirled
them away

after grasping the doctors hand a she stood victorious and proud
before him after grasping the hand of mr lorry who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the car magno le
after kissing little lucie who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who
lifted her he took his wife in his arms and carried her up to their
rooms

lucie my own i am safe

o dearest charles let me thank god for this on my knees as i have
prayed to him

they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts when she was again in
his arms he said to her

and now speak to your father dearest no other man in all this france
could have done what he has done for me

she laid her head upon her fathers breast as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast long long ago he was happy in the return he
had made her he was recompensed for his suffering he was proud of his
strength you must not be weak my darling he remonstrated dont
tremble so i have saved him




vii a knock at the door


i have saved him it was not another of the dreams in which he had
often comeback he was really here and yet his wife trembled and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her

all the air round was so thick and dark the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others a she was to
her everyday shared the fate from which he had been clutched that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be
the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets her mind pursued
them looking for him among the condemned and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more

her father cheering her showed a compassionate superiority to this
womans weakness which was wonderful to see no garret no shoemaking
no one hundred and five north tower now he had accomplished the task
he had set himself his promise was redeemed he had saved charles let
them all lean upon him

their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind not only because that was
the safest way of life involving the least offence to the people but
because they were not rich and charles throughout his imprisonment
had had to pay heavily for his bad food and for his guard and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners partly on this account and
partly to avoid a domestic spy they kept no servant the citizen and
citizen ess who acted as porters at the courtyard gate rendered them
occasional service and jerry almost wholly transferred to them by
mr lorry had become their daily retainer and had his bed there every
night

it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty
equality fraternity or death that on the door or door post of every
house the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size at a certain convenient height from the ground mr
jerry crunchers name therefore duly embellished the door post down
below and as the afternoon shadows deepened the owner of that name
himself appeared from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles ev re monde called
darnay

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed in the doctors little household as
in very many others the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening in small quantities and at various small
shops to avoid attracting notice and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy was the general desire

for some months past miss pross and mr cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors the former carrying the money the latter the
basket every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted they fared forth on this duty and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful although miss pross through her long
association with a french family might have known as much of their
language as of her own if she had had a mind she had no mind in that
direction consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as she was
pleased to call it than mr cruncher did so her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article and if it happened not to be
the name of the things he wanted to look round for that thing lay hold
of it and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded she always
made a bargain for it by holding up as a statement of its just price
one fingerless than the merchant held up whatever his number might be

now mr cruncher said miss pross whose eyes were red with felicity
if you are ready i am

jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss pros ss service he had worn
all his rust off long ago but nothing would file his spiky head down

theres all manner of things wanted said miss pross and we shall
have a precious time of it we want wine among the rest nice toasts
these redheads will be drinking wherever we buy it

it will be much the same to your knowledge miss i should think
retorted jerry whether they drink your health or the old uns

who she said miss pross

mr cruncher with some diffidence explained himself as meaning old
nicks

has aid miss pros sit doesnt need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures they have but one and its midnight murder
and mischief

hush dear pray pray be cautious cried lucie

yes yes yes ill be cautious said miss pross but i may say
among ourselves that i do hope there will be no onion y and tobacco ey
smothering sin the form of embracing s all round going on in the
streets now ladybird never you stir from that fire till i comeback
take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dont move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till you see me again
may i ask a question doctor manette before i go

i think you may take that liberty the doctor answered smiling

for gracious sake dont talkabout liberty we have quite enough of
that said miss pross

hush dear again lucie remonstrated

well my sweet said miss pross nodding her head emphatically the
short and the long of it is that i am a subject of his most gracious
majesty king george the third miss pross curtsey ed at the name and
as such my maxim is confound their politics frustrate their k nav ish
tricks on him our hopes we fix god save the king

mr cruncher in an access of loyalty growling ly repeated the words
after miss pross like somebody at church

i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you though i wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice said miss pross approvingly
but the question doctor manette is there it was the good creatures
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all and to come at it in this chance manner is there any
prospect yet of our getting out of this place

i fear not yet it would be dangerous for charles yet

heigh ho hum said miss pross cheerfully repressing a sig has she
glanced at her darlings golden hair in the light of the fire then we
must have patience and wait thats all we must holdup our heads and
fight low as my brother solomon used to say now mr cruncher dont
you move ladybird

they went out leaving lucie and her husband her father and the
child by a bright fire mr lorry was expected back presently from the
banking house miss pross had lighted the lamp but had put it aside in
a corner that they might enjoy the firelight undisturbed little lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his armand he
in at one not rising much above a whisper began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prison wall and let out
a captive who had once done the fairy a service all was subdued and
quiet and lucie was more at ease than she had been

what is that she cried all at once

my dear said her father stopping in his story and laying his hand
on hers command yourself what a disordered state you are in the
least thing nothing startles you you your fathers daughter

i thought my father said lucie excusing herself with a paleface
and in a faltering voice that i heard strange feet upon the stairs

my love the staircase is as still as death

a she said the word a blow was struck upon the door

oh father father what can this be hide charles save him

my child said the doctor rising and laying his hand upon her
shoulder i have saved him what weakness is this my dear let me go
to the door

he took the lamp in his hand crossed the two intervening outer rooms
and opened it a rude clattering of feet over the floor and four rough
men in red caps armed with sabres and pistols entered the room

the citizen ev re monde called darnay said the first

who seeks him answered darnay

i seek him we seek him i know you ev re monde i saw you before the
tribunal today you are again the prisoner of the republic

the four surrounded him where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him

tell me how and why am i again a prisoner

it is enough that you return straight to the concierge rie and will
know tomorrow you are summoned for tomorrow

doctor manette whom this visitation had so turned into stone that he
stood with the lamp in his hand as if he were a statue made to hold it
moved after these words were spoken put the lamp down and confronting
the speaker and taking him not un gently by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt said

you know him you have said do you know me

yes i know you citizen doctor

we all know you citizen doctor said the other three

he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower voice
after a pause

will you answer his question to me then how does this happen

citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced to
the section of saint antoine this citizen pointing out the second who
had entered is from saint antoine

the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added

he is accused by saint antoine

of what asked the doctor

citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no
more if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them the republic goes before all
the people is supreme ev re monde we are pressed

one word the doctor entreated will you tell me who denounced him

it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of saint
antoine here

the doctor turned his eyes upon that man who moved uneasily on his
feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said

well truly it is against rule but he is denounced and gravely by
the citizen and citizen ess defarge and by one other

what other

do you ask citizen doctor

yes

then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be
answered tomorrow now i am dumb




viii a hand at cards


happily unconscious of the new calamity at home miss pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
pont neuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make mr cruncher with the basket walked at her side they
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers it
was a raw evening and the misty river blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked making guns for the army of the
republic woe to the man who played tricks with that army or got
undeserved promotion in it better for him that his beard had never
grown for the national razor shaved him close

having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of oil
for the lamp miss pross be thought herself of the wine they wanted
after peeping into several wine shops she stopped at the sign of the
good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the national palace
once and twice the tuileries where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy it had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed and though red with patriotic caps was
not so red as the rest sounding mr cruncher and finding him of her
opinion miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity
attended by her cavalier

slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one bare breasted
bare armed soot be grime d workman reading a journal aloud and of
the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid aside to be
resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep who in the
popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked in that attitude
like slumbering bears or dogs the two outlandish customers approached
the counter and showed what they wanted

as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a
corner and rose to depart in going he had to face miss pross no
sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered as cream and clapped
her hands

in a moment the whole company were on their feet that somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence everybody looked to see somebody fall but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man with all
the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican the woman
evidently english

what was said in this disappointing anticlimax by the disciples of the
good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something very
voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss
pross and her protector though they had been all ears but they had no
ears for anything in their surprise for it must be recorded that
not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation but
mr cruncher though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account was in a state of the greatest wonder

what is the matter said the man who had caused miss pross to scream
speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in
english

oh solomon dear solomon cried miss pross clapping her hands again
after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time
do i find you here

dont call me solomon do you want to be the death of me asked the
man in a furtive frightened way

brother brother cried miss pross bursting into tears have i ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question

then hold your meddlesome tongue said solomon and come out if you
want to speak to me pay for your wine and come out whos this man

miss pross shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother said through her tears mr cruncher

let him come out too said solomon does he think me a ghost

apparently mr cruncher did to judge from his look she said not a
word however and miss pross exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine as she did
so solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus
of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french
language which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits

now said solomon stopping at the dark street corner what do you
want

how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from cried miss pross to give me such a greeting and show me no
affection

there confound it there said solomon making adab at miss pros ss
lips with his own now are you content

miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence

if you expect me to be surprised said her brother solomonia m not
surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are here if
you really dont want to endanger my existence which i half believe you
do go your way sassoon as possible and let me go mine i am busy i
a man official

my english brother solomon mourned miss pross casting up her
tear fraught eyes that had the making sin him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country an official among foreigners and
such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his

i said so cried her brother interrupting i knew it you want to be
the death of me i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister just
asia m getting on

the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried miss pross far
rather would in ever see you again dear solomon though i have ever
loved you truly and ever shall say but one affectionate word to me
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i will
detain you no longer

good miss pros sas if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers as if mr lorry had not known it for a fact years
ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her

he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case
all the world over when mr cruncher touching him on the shoulder
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question

i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is john solomon
or solomon john

the official turned towards him with sudden distrust he had not
previously uttered a word

come said mr cruncher speakout you know which by the way
was more than he could do himself john solomon or solomon john she
calls you solomon and she must know being your sister and i know
you re john you know which of the two goes first and regarding that
name of pross likewise that war nt your name over the water

what do you mean

well i dont know all i mean for icant call to mind what your name
was over the water

no

no but ill swear it was a name of two syllables

indeed

yes t other ones was one syllable i know you you was a spy witness
at the bailey what in the name of the father of lies own father to
yourself was you called at that time

bars ad said another voice striking in

thats the name for a thousand pound cried jerry

the speaker who struck in was sydney carton he had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding coat and he stood at mr crunchers
elbow as negligently a she might have stood at the old bailey itself

dont be alarmed my dear miss p rossi arrived at mr lorry s to his
surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present
myself here to bega little talk with your brother i wish you had a
better employed brother than mr bars adi wish for your sake mr bars ad
was not a sheep of the prisons

sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaoler s the spy
who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared

ill tell you said sydney i lighted on you mr bars ad coming out
of the prison of the concierge rie while i was contemplating the walls
an hour or more ago you have a face to be remembered and i remember
faces well made curious by seeing you in that connection and having
a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your
direction i walked into the wine shop here close after you and
sat near you i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the
nature of your calling and gradually what i had done at random seemed
to shape itself into a purpose mr bars ad

what purpose the spy asked

it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the
street could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your
company at the office of tell sons bank for instance

under a threat

oh did i say that

then why should i go there

really mr bars adi cant say if you cant

do you mean that you wont say sir the spy ir resolutely asked

you apprehend me very clearly mr bars adi wont

cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill in such a business a she had in his secret mind
and with such amana she had to do with his practised eye saw it and
made the most of it

now it old you so said the spy casting a reproachful look a this
sister if any trouble comes of this its your doing

come come mr bars ad exclaimed sydney dont be ungrateful
but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction do you go with me to the bank

ill hear what you have got to say yes ill go with you

i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street let me take your arm miss pross this is not a good city
at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as your escort
knows mr bars adi will invite him to mr lorry s with us are we
ready come then

miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life
remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydney s armand looked up
in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a braced
purpose in the armand a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only
contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man she was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection and with sydney s friendly reassurances adequately to
heed what she observed

they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way to mr
lorry s which was within a few minutes walk john bars ad or solomon
pross walked a this side

mr lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tell sons who had looked
into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a good many years
ago he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger

miss pros ss brother sir said sydney mr bars ad

bars ad repeated the old gentleman bars adi have an association
with the name and with the face

it old you you had a remarkable face mr bars ad observed carton
coolly prays it down

a she took a chair himself he supplied the link that mr lorry wanted
by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial mr lorry
immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence

mr bars ad has been recognised by miss pros sas the affectionate
brother you have heard of said sydney and has acknowledged the
relationship i pass to worse news darnay has been arrested again

struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you
tell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am about
to return to him

arrested for all that when was it done mr bars ad

just now if at all

mr bars ad is the best authority possible sir said sydney and i
have it from mr bars ads communication to a friend and brother sheep
over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place he left the
messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter there is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken

mr lorry s business eye read in the speakers face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point confused but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was
silently attentive

now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrow you said he
would be before the tribunal again tomorrow mr bars ad

yes i believe so

in as good stead tomorrow as today but it may not be so i own
to you i am shaken mr lorry by doctor manette s not having had the
power to prevent this arrest

he may not have known of it beforehand said mr lorry

but that very circumstance would be alarming when were member how
identified he is with his son in law

thats true mr lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand a this
chin and his troubled eyes on carton

in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes let the doctor play the winning game i
will play the losing one nomans life here is worth purchase anyone
carried home by the people today maybe condemned tomorrow now the
stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend
in the concierge rie and the friend i purpose to myself to win is mr
bars ad

you need have good cards sir said the spy

ill run them over ill see what i hold mr lorry you know what a
brute i am i wish you d give me a little brandy

it was put before him and he drank off a glass fuld rank off another
glass ful pushed the bottle thoughtfully away

mr bars ad he went on in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary of republican
committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret in former
so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman
is less open to suspicion of sub or nation in those characters than a
frenchman represents himself to his employers under a false name
that savery good card mr bars ad now in the employ of the republican
french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
english government the enemy of france and freedom that san excellent
card inference clear as day in this region of suspicion that mr
bars ad still in the pay of the aristocratic english government is the
spy of pitt the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom
the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find that sa card not to be beaten have you followed my
hand mr bars ad

not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily

i play my ace denunciation of mr bars ad to the nearest section
committee look over your hand mr bars ad and see what you have dont
hurry

he drew the bottle near poured out another glass ful of brandy and
drank it off he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him seeing i the
poured out and drank another glass ful

look over your hand carefully mr bars ad take time

it was a poorer hand than he suspected mr bars ad saw losing cards
in it that sydney carton knew nothing of thrown out of his honourable
employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there not because he was not wanted there our english reasons for
vaunt ing our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date he knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted service in
france first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the native she
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint
antoine and defarge swine shop had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning doctor manette s imprisonment
release and history as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the defarge sand tried the mon madame
defarge and had broken down with them signally he always remembered
with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved
he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over
again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up he knew as everyone employed as
he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that inspite of
his utmost ter givers ation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror a word might bring it down upon him once denounced and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash
his last chance of life besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify
the holder in growing rather livid a she turned them over

you scarcely seem to like your hand said sydney with the greatest
composure do you play

i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner a she turned to mr
lorry i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to
put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace
of which he has spoken i admit that i am a spy and that it is
considered a discreditable station though it must be filled by
somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one

i play my ace mr bars ad said carton taking the answer on himself
and looking a this watch without any scruple in a very few minutes

i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to
hook mr lorry into the discussion that your respect for my sister

i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother said sydney carton

you think not sir

i have thoroughly made up my mind about it

the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour
received such a check from the in scr ut ability of carton who was a
mystery to wiser and honest er men than he that it faltered here and
failed him while he was at a loss carton said resuming his former air
of contemplating cards

and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i
have another good card here not yet enumerated that friend and
fellow sheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons
who was he

french you dont know him said the spy quickly

french eh repeated carton musing and not appearing to notice him
at all though he echoed his word well he maybe

is i assure you said the spy though its not important

though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanical
way though its not important no its not important no yeti know
the face

i think not i am sure not it cant be said the spy

it cant be muttered sydney carton retrospectively and idling his
glass which fortunately was a small one again cant bespoke good
french yet like a foreigner i thought

provincial said the spy

no foreign cried carton striking his open hand on the table as a
light broke clearly on his mind cly disguised but the same man we
had that man before us at the old bailey

now there you are hasty sir said bars ad with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really give
mean advantage over you cly who i will unreservedly admit at this
distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead several years i
attended him in his last illness he was buried in london at the church
of saint pancras in the fields his unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but i helped
to lay him in his coffin

here mr lorry became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall tracing it to its source he discovered it
to because d by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on mr crunchers head

let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair to show you
how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is i will
lay before you a certificate of c lys burial which i happened to have
carried in my pocketbook with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it ever since there it is oh look at it look at it you may take
it in your hand its no forgery

here mr lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and
mr cruncher rose and stepped forward his hair could not have been more
violently on endif it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that jack built

unseen by the spy mr cruncher stood a this side and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff

that there roger cly master said mr cruncher with a taciturn and
ironbound visage so you put him in his coffin

i did

who took him out of it

bars ad leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean

i mean said mr cruncher that he war nt never in it no no the
ill have my head took off if he was ever in it

the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at jerry

i tell you said jerry that you buried paving stones and earth in
that there coffin dont go and tell me that you buried cly it was a
take in me and two more knows it

how do you know it

whats that to you e cod growled mr cruncher its you i have got a
old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen
id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea

sydney carton who with mr lorry had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business here requested mr cruncher to moderate and
explain himself

at another time sir he returned evasively the present time is
i llc on we nient for explain in what i stand to is that he knows well
wot that there cly was never in that there coffin let him say he was
insomuch as a word of one syllable and ill either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea mr cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offeror ill out and announce him

humph i see one thing said cartoni hold another card mr bars ad
impossible herein raging paris with suspicion filling the air for
you to out live denunciation when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself who moreover has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again
a plot in the prisons of the foreigner against the republic a strong
card a certain guillotine card do you play

no returned the spy i throw up i confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob that i only got away from england at the risk
of being ducked to death and that cly was so ferreted up and down that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham though how this
man knows it was as ham is a wonder of wonders to me

never you trouble your head about this man retorted the contentious
mr cruncher youll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman and look here once more mr cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea

the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton and said
with more decision it has come to a point i go on duty soon and
cant over stay my time you told me you had a proposal what is it
now it is of no use asking too much of me ask metodo anything in my
office putting my head in great extra danger and i had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent in short
i should make that choice you talk of desperation we are all desperate
here remember i may denounce you if i think proper and i can swear my
way through stonewalls and so can others now what do you want with
me

not very much you area turnkey at the concierge rie

i tell you once for all there is no such thing as an escape possible
said the spy firmly

why need you tell me what i have not asked you area turnkey at the
concierge rie

i am sometimes

you can be when you choose

i can pass in and out when i choose

sydney carton filled another glass with brandy poured it slowly out
upon the hearth and watched it as it dropped it being all spent he
said rising

so far we have spoken before these two because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me come
into the darkroom here and let us have one final word alone




ix the game made


while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
darkroom speaking so low that not a sound was heard mr lorry looked
at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust that honest tradesman s
manner of receiving the look did not inspire confidence he changed the
leg on which he rested as often as if he had fifty of those limbs
and were trying them all he examined his fingernails with a very
questionable closeness of attention and whenever mr lorry s eye caught
his he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it which is seldom if ever known to bean
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character

jerry said mr lorry come here

mr cruncher came forward sideways with one of his shoulders in advance
of him

what have you been besides a messenger

after some cogitation accompanied with an intent look a this patron
mr cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying agi cul to oral
character

my mind mis gives me much said mr lorry angrily shaking a forefinger
at him that you have used the respectable and great house of tell sons
as a blind and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description if you have dont expect me to be friend you when you
get back to england if you have dont expect me to keep your secret
tell sons shall not be imposed upon

i hope sir pleaded the abashed mr cruncher that a gentleman like
yourself wo tive had the honour of odd jobbing till im grey at it
would think twice about harming of me even if i two s so i dont say it
is but even if i two sandwhich it is to be took into account that if
i two sit wouldnt even then be all o one side the red be two sides
to it there might be medical doctors at the present hour a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman dont pickup his
far dens far dens non or yet his half far dens half far dens non or
yet his quarter a banking away like smoke at tell sons and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly a going in and going
out to their own carriages ah equally like smoke if not more so
well that ud be imposing too on tell sons for you can not sars e the
goose and not the gander and here smrs cruncher or least way swos
in the old england times and would be tomorrow if cause given
a flop pin again the business to that degree as is ruin ating stark
ruin ating whereas them medical doctors wives dont flop catch em at
it or if they flop their flopping s goes in favour of more patients
and how can you rightly have one without t other the nwot with
undertakers and wot with parish clerks and wot with sex tons and wot
with private watchmen all a war icious and all in it a man wouldnt get
much by it even if i two s so and wot little am and id get would never
prosper with him mr lorry hed never have no good of i the d want
all along to be out of the line if he could see his way out being
once in even if i two s so

ugh cried mr lorry rather relenting nevertheless i am shocked at
the sight of you

now what i would humbly offer to you sir pursued mr cruncher
even if i two s so which i dont say it is

dont prev a rica te said mr lorry

no i will not sir returned mr crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice which i dont say it is wot i
would humbly offer to you sir would be this upon that there stool at
that there bar sets that there boy of mine brought up and growed up to
beaman wot will errand you message you general light job you till
your heels is where your head is if such should be your wishes if it
wos so which i still dont say it is for i will not prewar icate to
you sir let that there boy keep his fathers place and take care of
his mother dont blow upon that boys father do not do it sir and
let that father go into the line of the reg lar diggin and make amends
for what he would have un dug if i two s so by diggin of em in with
a will and with con wic tions respect in the futur keep in of em safe
that mr lorry said mr cruncher wiping his forehead with his
armas an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse is wot i would respectfully offer to you sir a man dont
see all this here ago in on dreadful round him in the way of subjects
without heads dear me plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that without havin his serious thoughts of
things and these here would be mine if i two s so entreat in of you
fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now i up and said in the good
cause when i might have kep it back

that atleast is true said mr lorry say no more now it maybe
that i shall yet stand your friend if you deserve it and repent in
action not in words i want no more words

mr cruncher knuckled his forehead as sydney carton and the spy
returned from the darkroom adieu mr bars ad said the former our
arrangement thus made you have nothing to fear from me

he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against mr lorry when they
were alone mr lorry asked him what he had done

not much if it should go ill with the prisoner i have ensured access
to him once

mr lorry s countenance fell

it is all i could do said carton to propose too much would be
to put this mans head under the axe and a she himself said nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced it was obviously the
weakness of the position there is no help for it

but access to him said mr lorry if it should go ill before the
tribunal will not save him

in ever said it would

mr lorry s eyes gradually sought the fire his sympathy with his
darling and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest gradually
weakened them he was an oldman now overborne with anxiety of late
and his tears fell

you area goodman and a true friend said carton in an altered
voice forgive me if i notice that you are affected i could not see my
father weep and sit by careless and i could not respect your
sorrow more if you were my father you are free from that misfortune
however

though he said the last words with a slip into his usual manner there
was a true feeling and respect both in histone and in his touch
that mr lorry who had never seen the better side of him was wholly
unprepared for he gave him his hand and carton gently press edit

to return to poor darnay said carton dont tell her of this
interview or this arrangement it would not enable her to goto see
him she might think it was contrived in case of the worse to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence

mr lorry had not thought of that and he looked quickly at carton to
see if it were in his mind it seemed to be he returned the look and
evidently understood it

she might think a thousand things carton said and any of them would
only add to her trouble dont speak of me to her as i said to you when
i first came i had better not see her i can put my handout to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do without that
you are going to her i hope she must be very desolate tonight

i am going now directly

i am glad of that she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you how does she look

anxious and unhappy but very beautiful

ah

it was along grieving sound like a sigh almost like as obit
attracted mr lorry s eyes to cartons face which was turned to the
fire a light or a shade the old gentleman could not have said which
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hillside on a
wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs which was tumbling forward he wore the white riding coat
and top boots then in vogue and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale with his long brown hair
all untrimmed hanging loose about him his indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr lorry
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log when it had
broken under the weight of his foot

i forgot i the said

mr lorry s eyes were again attracted to his face taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having
the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly
reminded of that expression

and your duties here have drawn to an end sir said carton turning
to him

yes as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so
unexpectedly i have at length done all that i can do here i hoped to
have left them in perfect safety and then to have quitted paris i have
my leave to pass i was ready to go

they were both silent

yours is along life to look backup on sir said carton wistfully

i am in my seventy eighth year

you have been useful all your life steadily and constantly occupied
trusted respected and looked up to

i have been a man of business ever since i have been a man indeed i
may say that i was a man of business when a boy

see what a place you fill at seventy eight how many people will miss
you when you leave it empty

a solitary old bachelor answered mr lorry shaking his head there
is nobody to weep for me

how can you say that wouldnt she weep for you wouldnt her child

yes yes thank god i didnt quite mean what i said

it is a thing to thank god for is it not

surely surely

if you could say with truth to your own solitary heart tonight
i have secured to myself the love and attachment the gratitude or
respect of no human creature i have won myself a tender place in no
regard i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by
your seventy eight years would be seventy eight heavy curses would they
not

you say truly mr cartoni think they would be

sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire and after a silence of a
few moments said

i should like to ask you does your childhood seem far off do the
days when you sat at your mothers knee seem days of very long ago

responding to his softened manner mr lorry answered

twenty years back yes at this time of my life no for as i draw
closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and
nearer to the beginning it seems to be one of the kind smoothing sand
preparing s of the way my heart is touched now by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep of my pretty young mother and iso old
and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not
so real with me and my faults were not confirmed in me

i understand the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright flush and
you are the better for it

i hope so

carton terminated the conversation hereby rising to help him on with
his outer coat but you said mr lorry reverting to the theme you
are young

yes said cartoni am not old but my young way was never the way to
age enough of me

and of me i am sure said mr lorry are you going out

ill walk with you to her gate you know my vagabond and restless
habits if i should prowl about the streets along time dont be
uneasy i shall reappear in the morning you goto the court tomorrow

yes unhappily

i shall be there but only as one of the crowd my spy will find a
place for me take my arm sir

mr lorry did so and they went downstairs and out in the streets a
few minutes brought them to mr lorry s destination carton left him
there but lingere data little distance and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut and touched i the had heard of her going to
the prison everyday she came out here he said looking about him
turned this way must have trod on these stones often let me follow in
her steps

it waste no clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force
where she had stood hundreds of times a littlewood sawyer having
closed his shop was smoking his pipe a this shop door

goodnight citizen said sydney carton pausing in going by for the
man eyed him inquisitively

goodnight citizen

how goes the republic

you mean the guillotine not ill sixty three today we shall mount
to a hundred soon samson and his men complain sometimes of being
exhausted hahaha he is so droll that samson such a barber

do you often goto see him

shave always everyday what a barber you have seen him at work

never

go and see him when he has a good batch figure this to yourself
citizen he shaved the sixty three today in less than two pipes less
than two pipes word of honour

as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to explain
how he timed the executioner carton was so sensible of arising desire
to strike the life out of him that he turned away

but you are not english said the wood sawyer though you wear
english dress

yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder

you speak like a frenchman

i a man old student here

aha a perfect frenchman goodnight englishman

goodnight citizen

but go and see that droll dog the little man persisted calling after
him and take a pipe with you

sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper then traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well several dark and dirty streets much dirtier than usual
for the best public thoroughfares remained un cleansed in those times of
terror he stopped at a chemists shop which the owner was closing with
his own hands a small dim crooked shop kept in a tortuous uphill
thoroughfare by a small dim crooked man

giving this citizen too goodnight a she confronted him a this
counter he laid the scrap of paper before him whew the chemist
whistled softly a she read it hihihi

sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said

for you citizen

for me

you will be careful to keep them separate citizen you know the
consequences of mixing them

perfectly

certain small packets were made and given to him he put them one by
one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money for them
and deliberately left the shop there is nothing more to do said he
glancing upward at the moon until tomorrow icant sleep

it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast sailing clouds nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance it was the settled manner of a tired man who
had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck into
his road and saw it send

long ago when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise he had followed his father to the grave his
mother had died years before these solemn words which had been
read a this fathers grave arose in his mind a she went down the dark
streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty three who had been that day put to death
and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons
and still of tomorrows and tomorrows the chain of association that
brought the words home like a rusty old ships anchor from the deep
might have been easily found he did not seek it but repeated them and
went on

with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them in the towers of the churches where no prayers
were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self destruction from years of priestly impostors plunderers and
profligate sin the distant burial places reserved as they wrote upon
the gates for eternal sleep in the abounding gaols and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the guillotine with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury sydney carton crossed the seine again for
the lighter streets

few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches we reliable to be
suspected and gentility hid its head in red night caps and put on heavy
shoes and trudged but the theatres were all well filled and the
people poured cheerfully out a she passed and went chatting home at
one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with am other looking
for away across the street through the mud he carried the child over
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth
in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die

now that the streets were quiet and the night wore on the words
were in the echoes of his feet and were in the air perfectly calm
and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself a she walked but he
heard them always

the night wore out and a she stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river walls of the island of paris where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead face out of the
sky then the night with the moon and the stars turned pale and died
and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to
deaths dominion

but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that burden
of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays
and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun while the river
sparkled under it

the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like a congenial
friend in the morning stillness he walked by the stream far from the
houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank when he awoke and was a foot again he lingered there yet a little
longer watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless until the
stream absorbed it and carried it on to these a like me

a trading boat with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf then
glided into his view floated by him and died away as its silent track
in the water disappeared the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindness es and errors
ended in the words i am the resurrection and the life

mr lorry was already out when he got back and it was easy to surmise
where the good oldman was gone sydney carton drank nothing but a
little coffee ate some bread and having washed and changed to refresh
himself went out to the place of trial

the court was all a stir and a buzz when the blacksheep whom many fell
away from in dread pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd
mr lorry was there and doctor manette was there she was there
sitting beside her father

when her husband was brought in she turned a lookup on him so
sustaining so encouraging so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness yet so courageous for his sake that it called the healthy
blood into his face brightened his glance and animated his heart if
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look on sydney
carton it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly

before that unjust tribunal there was little or no order of procedure
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing there could have
been no such revolution if all laws forms and ceremonies had not
first been so monstrously abused that the suicidal vengeance of the
revolution was to scatter them all to the winds

every eye was turned to the jury the same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before and tomorrow and the day
after eager and prominent among them one man with a craving face and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators a life thirsting
cannibal looking bloody minded jury man the jacques three of st
antoine the whole jury as a jury of dogs em pannell ed to try the deer

every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor
no favourable leaning in that quarter today a fell uncompromising
murderous business meaning there every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd and gleamed at it approvingly and heads nodded at one
another before bending forward with as trained attention

charles ev re monde called darnay released yesterday re accused and
retaken yesterday indictment delivered to him last night suspected and
denounced enemy of the republic aristocrat one of a family of tyrants
one of a race proscribed for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people charles ev re monde
called darnay in right of such proscription absolutely dead in law

to this effect in as few or fewer words the public prosecutor

the president asked was the accused openly denounced or secretly

openly president

by whom

three voices ernest defarge wine vendor of st antoine

good

therese defarge his wife

good

alexandre manette physician

a great uproar took place in the court and in the midst of it doctor
manette was seen pale and trembling standing where he had been seated

president i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter my
daughter and those dear to her are far dearer to me than my life who
and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband
of my child

citizen manette be tranquil to fail in submission to the authority of
the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law as to what is dearer
to you than life nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
republic

loud acclamations hailed this rebuke the president rang his bell and
with warmth resumed

if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself you would have no duty but to sacrifice her listen to what is
to follow in the meanwhile be silent

frantic acclamations were again raised doctor manette sat down with
his eyes looking around and his lips trembling his daughter drew
closer to him the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together
and restored the usual hand to his mouth

defarge was produced when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment and of
his having been a mere boy in the doctors service and of the release
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him
this short examination followed for the court was quick with its work

you did good service at the taking of the bastille citizen

i believe so

here an excited woman screeched from the crowd you were one of the
best patriots there why not say so you were a cannon ier that day
there and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it fell patriots is peak the truth

it was the vengeance who amidst the warm commendations of the audience
thus assisted the proceedings the president rang his bell but the
vengeance warming with encouragement shrieked i defy that bell
where in she was likewise much commended

inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille
citizen

i knew said defarge looking down a this wife who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised looking steadily up at him
i knew that this prisoner of whom is peak had been confined in a cell
known as one hundred and five north tower i knew it from himself he
knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five north tower
when he made shoes under my care as i serve my gun that day i resolve
when the place shall fall to examine that cell it falls i mount to
the cell with a fellow citizen who is one of the jury directed by a
gaoler i examine it very closely in a hole in the chimney where a
stone has been worked out and replaced i find a written paper this is
that written paper i have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of doctor manette this is the writing of doctor manette
i confide this paper in the writing of doctor manette to the hands of
the president

let it be read

in a dead silence and stillness the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly a this wife his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife and all the other eyes there
intent upon the doctor who saw none of them the paper was read as
follows




x the substance of the shadow


i alexandre manette unfortunate physician native of beauvais and
afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the bastille during the last month of the year i write
it at stolen intervals under every difficulty i design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it some pitying hand may find it there when i
and my sorrows are dust

these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney mixed
with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity hope
has quite departed from my breast i know from terrible warnings i have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired but i
solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right
mind that my memory is exact and circumstantial and that i write the
truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words whether they
be ever read by men or not at the eternal judgment seat

one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think the
twenty second of the month in the year i was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air
at an hours distance from my place of residence in the street of the
school of medicine when a carriage came along behind me driven very
fast as i stood aside to let that carriage pass apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down ahead was put out at the window and a
voice called to the driver to stop

the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could re in in his horses
and the same voice called to me by my name i answered the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and a light before i came up with it

i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to
conceal themselves as they stood side by side near the carriage door
i also observed that they both looked of about my ownage or rather
younger and that they were greatly a like in stature manner voice
and as far as i could see face too

you are doctor manette said one

i am

doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other the young
physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or two
has made arising reputation in paris

gentlemen i returned i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so
graciously

we have been to your residence said the first and not being
so fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of
overtaking you will you please to enter the carriage

the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these words
were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door
they were armed i was not

gentlemen said i pardon me but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case to
which i am summoned

the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second doctor
your clients are people of condition as to the nature of the case
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it enough will you please to
enter the carriage

i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence they both
entered after me the last springing in after putting up the steps the
carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed

i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred i have no doubt that
it is word for word the same i describe everything exactly as it took
place constraining my mind not to wander from the task where i make
the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the time and put my
paper in its hiding place



the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and
emerged upon the country road at two thirds of a league from the
barrier i did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards
when i traversed it it struck out of the main avenue and presently
stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed to the door of the house it was not opened immediately in
answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the face

there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs but the
other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in like manner
with his arm the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
a like that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers

from the time of our a lighting at the outer gate which we found
locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had
re locked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber i was
conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain
lying on a bed

the patient was a woman of great beauty and young assuredly not much
past twenty her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs i noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentlemans dress on one of them which was a fringed
scarf for adress of ceremony i saw the armorial bearings of a noble
and the lettere

i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient
for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth and was
in danger of suffocation my first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing and in moving the scarf aside the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight

i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down and looked into her face here yes were dilated and
wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeated the
words my husband my father and my brother and then counted up to
twelve and said hush for an instant and no more she would pause
to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin again and she
would repeat the cry my husband my father and my brother and
would count up to twelve and say hush there was no variation in the
order or the manner there was no cessation but the regular moments
pause in the utterance of these sounds

how long i asked has this lasted

to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the
younger by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority it
was the elder who replied since about this hour last night

she has a husband a father and a brother

a brother

i do not address her brother

he answered with great contempt no

she has some recent association with the number twelve

the younger brother impatiently rejoined with twelve oclock

see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast how
useless iamas you have brought me if i had known what i was coming
to see i could have come provided as it is time must be lost there
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place

the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily there is
a case of medicines here and brought it from a closet and put it on
the table



i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my
lips if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those

do you doubt the masked the younger brother

you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no
more

i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many
efforts the dose that i desired to give as i intended to repeat it
after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then
sat down by the side of the bed there was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance wife of the man downstairs who had retreated into
a corner the house was damp and decayed in differently
furnished evidently recently occupied and temporarily used some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deaden the
sound of the shrieks they continued to be uttered in the irregular
succession with the cry my husband my father and my brother the
counting up to twelve and hush the frenzy was so violent that i had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms but i had looked to
them to see that they were not painful the only spark of encouragement
in the case was that my hand upon the sufferers breast had this much
soothing influence that for minutes at a time it tranquilli sed the
figure it had no effect upon the cries no pendulum could be more
regular

for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers looking on
before the elder said

there is another patient

i was startled and asked is it a pressing case

you had better see he carelessly answered and took up a light



the other patient lay in a backroom across a second staircase which
was a species of loft over as table there was a low plastered ceiling
to apart of it the rest was open to the ridge of the tiled roof and
there were beams across hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place fagot s for firing and a heap of apples in sandi had to
passthrough that part to get at the other my memory is circumstantial
and unshaken i try it with these details and i see them all in
this my cell in the bastille near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity as i saw them all that night

on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay a
handsome peasant boy a boy of not more than seventeen at the most
he lay on his back with his teeth set his righthand clenched on his
breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward i could not see
where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him but i could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point

i am a doctor my poor fellow said i let me examine it

i do not want it examined he answered let it be

it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand away
the wound was as word thrust received from twenty to twenty four hours
before but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay he was then dying fast as i turned my eyes to the elder
brother i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare or rabbit not at all
as if he were a fellow creature

how has this been done monsieur said i

a crazed young common dog a serf forced my brother to draw upon him
and has fallen by my brothers sword like a gentleman

there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this
answer the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy or about his fate

the boys eyes had slowly moved to him a she had spoken and they now
slowly moved to me

doctor they are very proud these nobles but we common dogs are
proud too sometimes they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us but
we have a little pride left sometimes she have you seen her doctor

the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the
distance he referred to them as if she we relying in our presence

i said i have seen her

she is my sister doctor they have had their shameful rights these
nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years but we
have had good girls among us i know it and have heard my father say
so she was a good girls he was betrothed to a good youngman too a
tenant of his we were all tenants of his that mans who stands there
the other is his brother the worst of a bad race

it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis

we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common dogs
are by those superior beings taxed by him without mercy obliged to
work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn a this mill obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have abit of meat we
ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closed that his
people should not see it and take it from us i say we were so robbed
and hunted and were made so poor that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and that what we should
most pray for was that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out

i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth
like a fire i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere but i had never seen it breakout until i saw it in the
dying boy

nevertheless doctor my sister married he was ailing at that time
poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage our dog hut as that man would call it she had not
been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her and admired
her and asked that man to lend her to him for what are husbands among
us he was willing enough but my sister was good and virtuous and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine what did the two
then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her
willing

the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the
looker on and is a win the two faces that all he said was true the two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see even in this
bastille the gentlemans all negligent indifference the peasants all
trodden down sentiment and passionate revenge

you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts and drive us they so harnessed him and
drove him you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their
grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night and ordered him back into his harness in the day but he was
not persuaded no taken out of harness one day at noon to feed if he
could find food he sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the
bell and died on her bosom

nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong he forced back the gathering shadows of death as
he forced his clenched righthand to remain clenched and to cover his
wound

then with that mans permission and even with his aid his
brother took her away inspite of what i know she must have told his
brother and what that is will not belong unknown to you doctor if
it is now his brother took her away for his pleasure and diversion
for a little while i saw her pass me on the road when i took the
tidings home our fathers heart burst he never spoke one of the words
that filled it i took my young sister for i have another to a place
beyond the reach of this man and where atleast she will never be
his vassal then i tracked the brother here and last night climbed
in a common dog but sword in hand where is the loft window it was
somewhere here

the room was darkening to his sight the world was narrowing around
him i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor as if there had been a struggle

she heard me and ran in it old her not to come near u still he was
dead he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money then struck
at me with a whip but i though a common dog so struck at him as to
make him draw let him break into as many pieces a she will the sword
that he stained with my common blood he drew to defend himself thrust
at me with all his skill for his life

my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments of
a broken sword lying among the hay that weapon was a gentlemans in
another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers

now lift me up doctor lift me up where is he

he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking that he
referred to the brother

he proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me where is the
man who was he return my face to him

i did so raising the boys head against my knee but invested for the
moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely obliging
me to rise too or i could not have still supported him

marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide and
his righthand raised in the days when all these things are to be
answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad race to
answer for them i mark this cross of blood upon you as a sign that
i do it in the days when all these things are to be answered for
i summon your brother the worst of the bad race to answer for them
separately i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that i do
it

twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his
forefinger drew across in the air he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him
down dead



when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity i knew that this might last
for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave

i repeated the medicines i had given her and is at at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced she never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words they were always my husband my father and my brother
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve hush

this lasted twenty six hours from the time when i first saw her i had
come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began to
falter i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity and
by and bye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead

it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after along and
fearful storm i released her arms and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn it was then that i knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
am other have arisen and it was then that i lost the little hope i had
had of her

is she dead asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the
elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse

not dead said i but like to die

what strength there is in these common bodies he said looking down
at her with some curiosity

there is prodigious strength i answered him in sorrow and
despair

he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in a
subdued voice

doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds i
recommended that your aid should be invited your reputation is high
and as a youngman with your fortune to make you are probably mindful
of your interest the things that you see here are things to be seen
and not spoken of

i listened to the patients breathing and avoided answering

do you honour me with your attention doctor

monsieur said i in my profession the communications of patients
are always received in confidence i was guarded in my answer for i
was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen

her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried the
pulse and the heart there was life and no more looking round as i
resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me



i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness that i must a bridge this narrative there is no confusion or
failure in my memory it can recall and could detail every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers

she lingered for a week towards the last i could understand some few
syllables that she said to me by placing m year close to her lips she
asked me where she was and it old her who i was and it old her it
was in vain that i asked her for her family name she faintly shook her
head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done

i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told the
brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day until
then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there but when it came to
that they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her as
if the thought passed through my mind i were dying too

i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and that
peasant a boy the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family and was ridiculous as often as i caught the younger
brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply
for knowing what i knew from the boy he was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder but i saw this i also saw that i was an in cum b rance
in the mind of the elder too

my patient died two hours before midnight at a time by my watch
answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her i was alone
with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended

the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient to ride
away i had heard the malone at the bedside striking their boots with
their riding whips and loitering up and down

at last she is dead said the elder when i went in

she is dead said i

i congratulate you my brother were his words a she turned round

he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking he now
gave me a rouleau of gold i took it from his hand but laid it on
the table i had considered the question and had resolved to accept
nothing

pray excuse me said i under the circumstances no

they exchanged looks but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to
them and we parted without another word on either side



i am weary weary weary worn down by misery i can not read what i
have written with this gaunt hand

early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box with my name on the outside from the first i had anxiously
considered what i ought to do i decided that day to write privately
to the minister stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been
summoned and the place to which i had gone in effect stating all the
circumstances i knew what court influence was and what the immunities
of the nobles were and i expected that the matter would never be
heard of but i wished to relieve my own mind i had kept the matter a
profound secret even from my wife and this too i resolved to state
in my letter i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger but
i was conscious that there might be danger for others if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed

i was much engaged that day and could not complete my letter that
night i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it
it was the last day of the year the letter was lying before me just
completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished to see me



i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself it is
so cold so dark my senses are so benumbed and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful

the lady was young engaging and handsome but not marked for long
life she was in great agitation she presented herself to me as the
wife of the marquis stev re monde i connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i
had seen that nobleman very lately

my memory is still accurate but i can not write the words of our
conversation i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was and i
know not at what times i maybe watched she had in part suspected and
in part discovered the main facts of the cruel story of her husbands
share in it and my being resorted to she did not know that the girl
was dead her hope had been she said in great distress to show her
in secret a womans sympathy her hope had been to avert the wrath of
heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many

she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living and
her greatest desire was to help that sister i could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothing her
inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been the hope
that i could tell her the name and place of abode whereas to this
wretched hour i am ignorant of both



these scraps of paper fail me one was taken from me with a warning
yesterday i must finish my record today

she was a good compassionate lady and not happy in her marriage how
could she be the brother distrusted and disliked her and his influence
was all opposed to her she stood in dread of him and in dread of her
husband too when i handed her down to the door there was a child a
pretty boy from two to three years old in her carriage

for his sake doctors he said pointing to him in tears i would do
all i can to make what poor amends i can he will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise i have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this it will one day be required of him what
i have left to call my own it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels i will make it the first charge of his life to bestow with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother on this injured family if
the sister can be discovered

she kissed the boy and said caressing him it is for thine own dear
sake thou wilt be faithful little charles the child answered her
bravely yes i kissed her hand and she took him in her arms and
went away caressing him in ever saw her more

as she had mentioned her husbands name in the faith that i knew it
i added no mention of it to my letter i sealed my letter and not
trusting it out of my own hands delivered it myself that day

that night the last night of the year towards nine oclock a man in
a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softly followed
my servant ernest defarge a youth upstairs when my servant came
into the room where is at with my wife o my wife beloved of my heart
my fair young english wife we saw the man who was supposed to beat
the gate standing silent behind him

an urgent case in the ruest honore he said it would not detain me
he had a coach in waiting

it brought me here it brought me to my grave when i was clear of the
house a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind and
my arms were pinioned the two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner and identified me with a single gesture the marquis took from
his pocket the letter i had written showed it me burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held and extinguished the ashes with his foot
not a word was spoken i was brought here i was brought to my living
grave

if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers in all these frightful years to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them but
now i believe that the mark of the redcross is fatal to them and that
they have no part in his mercies and them and their descendants to the
last of their race i alexandre manette unhappy prisoner do this last
night of the year in my unbearable agony denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for i denounce them to heaven
and to earth

a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done a
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time
and there was not ahead in the nation but must have dropped before it

little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to show
how the defarge shad not made the paper public with the other captured
bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept it biding their
time little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathema tis ed by saint antoine and was wrought into the fatal register
the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day against such denunciation

and all the worse for the doomed man that the denounce r was a
well known citizen his own attached friend the father of his wife one
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity and for sacrifices and
self immolation son the peoples altar therefore when the president
said else had his own head quivered on his shoulders that the good
physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan there was wild excitement patriotic fervour not a touch of
human sympathy

much influence around him has that doctor murmured madame defarge
smiling to the vengeance save him now my doctor save him

at every jury mans vote there was a roar another and another roar and
roar

unanimously voted at heart and by descent an aristocrat an enemy
of the republic a notorious oppressor of the people back to the
concierge rie and death within four and twenty hours




xi dusk


the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die fell under
the sentence as if she had been mortally stricken but she uttered no
sound and so strong was the voice within her representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it that it quickly raised her even from that shock

the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors
the tribunal adjourned the quick noise and movement of the courts
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased when lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband with nothing in her face
but love and consolation

if i might touch him if i might embrace him on ceo good citizens if
you would have so much compassion for us

there was but a gaoler left along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night and bars ad the people had all poured out to the
show in the streets bars ad proposed to the restlet her embrace
him then it is but a moment it was silently acquiesced in and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place where he by
leaning over the dock could fold her in his arms

farewell dear darling of my soul my parting blessing on my love we
shall meet again where the weary are at rest

they were her husbands words a she held her to his bosom

i can bear it dear charles i am supported from above dont suffer
for me a parting blessing for our child

is end it to her by you i kiss her by you i say farewell to her by
you

my husband no a moment he was tearing himself apart from her
we shall not be separated long i feel that this will break my heart
by and bye but i will do my duty while i can and when i leave her god
will raise up friends for her a she did for me

her father had followed her and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them but that darnay put out a hand and seized him crying

no no what have you done what have you done that you should kneel
to us we know now what a struggle you made of old we know now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent and when you knew it we
know now the natural antipathy you strove against and conquered for
her dear sake we thankyou with all our hearts and all our love and
duty heaven be with you

her fathers only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair
and wring them with a shriek of anguish

it could not be otherwise said the prisoner all things have worked
together as they have fallen out it was the always vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you good could never come of such evil a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning be comforted and forgive me heaven
bless you

a she was drawn away his wife released him and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer and
with a radiant lookup on her face in which there was even a comforting
smile a she went out at the prisoners door she turned laid her head
lovingly on her fathers breast tried to speak to him and fella this
feet

then issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved
sydney carton came and took her up only her father and mr lorry were
with her his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her head
yet there was an air about him that was not all of pity that had a
flush of pride in it

shall i take her to a coach i shall never feel her weight

he carried her lightly to the door and laid her tenderly down in a
coach her father and their old friend got into it and he took his seat
beside the driver

when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden he lifted her again and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms there he laid her down on a couch where
her child and miss pros swept over her

dont recall her to herself he said softly to the latter she is
better so dont revive her to consciousness while she only faints

oh carton carton dear carton cried little lucie springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him in a burst of grief now that
you have come i think you will do something to help mamma something to
save papa o look at her dear carton can you of all the people who
love her bear to see her so

he bent over the child and laid her blooming cheek against his face he
put her gently from him and looked at her unconscious mother

before i go he said and paused i may kiss her

it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips he murmured some words the child who was nearest to
him told them afterwards and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady that she heard him say a life you love

when he had gone out into the next room he turned suddenly on mr lorry
and her father who were following and said to the latter

you had great influence but yesterday doctor manette let it atleast
be tried these judges and all the men in power are very friendly to
you and very re cognisant of your services are they not

nothing connected with charles was concealed from me i had the
strongest assurances that i should save him and i did he returned the
answer in great trouble and very slowly

try them again the hours between this and tomorrow afternoon are few
and short but try

i intend to try i will not rest a moment

that swell i have known such energy as yours do great things before
now though never he added with a smile and a sigh together such
great things as this but try of little worth as life is when we misuse
it it is worth that effort it would cost nothing to laydown if it
were not

i will go said doctor manette to the prosecutor and the president
straight and i willgoto others whom it is better not to name i will
write too and but stay there is a celebration in the streets and no
one will be accessible until dark

thats true well it is a forlorn hope at the best and not much the
forlorn er for being delayed till dark i should like to know how you
speed though mind i expect nothing when are you likely to have seen
these dread powers doctor manette

immediately after dark i should hope within an hour or two from
this

it will be dark soon after four let us stretch the hour or two if i
goto mr lorry sat nine shall i hear what you have done either from
our friend or from yourself

yes

may you prosper

mr lorry followed sydney to the outer door and touching him on the
shoulder a she was going away caused him to turn

i have no hope said mr lorry in a low and sorrowful whisper

nor have i

if anyone of these men or all of these men were disposed to spare
him which is a large supposition for what is his life or any mans
to them i doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court

and so do ii heard the fall of the axe in that sound

mr lorry leaned his arm upon the door post and bowed his face upon it

dont despond said carton very gently dont grieve i encouraged
doctor manette in this idea because i felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her otherwise she might think his life was want only
thrown away or wasted and that might trouble her

yes yes yes returned mr lorry drying his eyes you are right
but he will perish there is no real hope

yes he will perish there is no real hope echoed carton

and walked with a settled step downstairs




xii darkness


sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to goat
tell sons banking house at nine he said with amusing face shall i
do well in the meantime to show myself i think so it is best that
these people should know there is such a man as i here it is a sound
precaution and maybe a necessary preparation but care care care
let me think it out

checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences his first impression was
confirmed it is best he said finally resolved that these people
should know there is such a man as i here and he turned his face
towards saint antoine

defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wine shop in
the saint antoine suburb it was not difficult for one who knew the city
well to find his house without asking any question having ascertained
its situation carton came out of those closer streets again and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner for the
first time in many years he had no strong drink since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on mr lorry s hearth like a man who had
done with it

it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out
into the streets again a she passed along towards saint antoine he
stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coat collar and
his wild hair this done he went on direct to defarge sand went in

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice this man whom he had seen upon
the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the
defarge s man and wife the vengeance assisted in the conversation like
a regular member of the establishment

as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very in different
french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced
to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered

he repeated what he had already said

english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows

after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong foreign
accent yes madame yes i am english

madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and a she
took up a jacob in journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning he heard her say is wear to you like ev re monde

defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening

how

good evening

oh good evening citizen filling his glass a hand good wine i
drink to the republic

defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like
madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like jacques three
pacific ally remarked he is so much in your mind see you madame
the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faith and you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
tomorrow

carton followed the lines and words of his paper with as low
forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face they were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together speaking low after a silence
of a few moments during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the jacob in editor they resumed
their conversation

it is true what madame says observed jacques three why stop there
is great force in that why stop

well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere after all
the question is still where

at extermination said madame

magnificent croaked jacques three the vengeance also highly
approved

extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather
troubled in general i say nothing against it but this doctor has
suffered much you have seen him today you have observed his face when
the paper was read

i have observed his face repeated madame contemptuously and angrily
yes i have observed his face i have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the republic let him take care of his face

and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner
the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him

i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i have observed
his daughter more times than one i have observed her today and i
have observed her other days i have observed her in the court and
i have observed her in the street by the prison let me but lift my
fingers he seemed to raise it the listeners eyes were always on
his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her as
if the axe had dropped

the citizen ess is superb croaked the jury man

she is an angel said the vengeance and embraced her

as to the e pursued madame implacably addressing her husband if it
depended on the e which happily it does not thou wouldst rescue this
man even now

no protested defarge not if to lift this glass would do it but i
would leave the matter there i says top there

see you then jacques said madame defarge wrath fully and see you
too my little vengeance see you both listen for other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors i have this race along time on my register
doomed to destruction and extermination ask my husband is that so

it is so assented defarge without being asked

in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls he finds
this paper of today and he brings it home and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut we read i there on this spot
by the light of this lamp ask him is that so

it is so assented defarge

that night i tell him when the paper is read through and the lamp is
burnt out and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars that i have now a secret to communicate ask him is
that so

it is so assented defarge again

i communicate to him that secret is mite this bosom with these two
hands as is mite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought up
among the fishermen of the seashore and that peasant family so injured
by the two ev re monde brothers as that bastille paper describes is my
family defarge that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister that husband was my sisters husband that unborn child
was their child that brother was my brother that father was my father
those dead are my dead and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me ask him is that so

it is so assented defarge once more

then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame but dont
tell me

both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath the listener could feel how white she was without seeing
her and both highly commended it defarge a weak minority interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis but
only elicited from his own wife are petition of her last reply tell
the wind and the fire where to stop not me

customers entered and the group was broken up the english customer
paid for what he had had perplexed ly counted his change and asked as
a stranger to be directed towards the national palace madame defarge
took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road
the english customer was not without his reflections then that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm lift it and strike under it sharp and
deep

but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present
himself in mr lorry s room again where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety he said he had been with lucie
until just now and had only left her for a few minutes to come and
keep his appointment her father had not been seen since he quitted the
banking house towards four oclock she had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save charles but they were very slight he had been
more than five hours gone where could he be

mr lorry waited until ten but doctor manette not returning and
he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged that he
should go back to her and come to the banking house again at midnight
in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor

he waited and waited and the clocks truck twelve but doctor manette
did not comeback mr lorry returned and found no tidings of him and
brought none where could he be

they were discussing this question and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him on
the stairs the instant he entered the room it was plain that all was
lost

whether he had really been to anyone or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets was never known a she stood staring at
them they asked him no question for his face told them everything

i can not find it said he and i must have it where is it

his head and throat were bare and a she spoke with a helpless look
straying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on the floor

where is my bench i have been looking everywhere for my bench and i
cant find it what have they done with my work time presses i must
finish those shoes

they looked at one another and their hearts died within them

come come said he in a whimpering miserable way let me get to
work give me my work

receiving no answer he to re his hair and be a this feet upon the
ground like a distracted child

dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with a dreadful
cry but give me my work what is to become of us if those shoes are
not done tonight

lost utterly lost

it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him
that as if by agreement they each putah and upon his shoulder and
soothed him to sitdown before the fire with a promise that he should
have his work presently he sank into the chair and brooded over the
embers and shed tears as if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy or a dream mr lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping

affected and impressed with terror as they both were by this spectacle
of ruin it was not a time to yield to such emotions his lonely
daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed to them both
too strongly again as if by agreement they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces carton was the first to speak

the last chance is gone it was not much yes he had better be taken
to her but before you go will you for a moment steadily attend to
med on task me why i make the stipulation siam going to make and
exact the promise i am going to exact i have a reason a good one

i do not doubt it answered mr lorry say on

the figure in the chair between them was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro and moaning they spoke in such at one as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sickbed in the
night

carton stooped to pickup the coat which lay almost entangling his
feet a she did so a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on the floor carton
took it up and there was a folded paper in it we should look
at this he said mr lorry nodded his consent he opened it and
exclaimed thank god

what is it asked mr lorry eagerly

a moment let me speak of it in its place first he put his hand in
his coat and took another paper from it that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city look at it you see sydney carton
an englishman

mr lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face

keep it for me until tomorrow i shall see him tomorrow you
remember and i had better not take it into the prison

why not

i dont know i prefer not to do so now take this paper that doctor
manette has carried about him it is a similar certificate enabling him
and his daughter and her child at anytime to pass the barrier and the
frontier you see

yes

perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil
yesterday when is it dated but no matter dont stay to look put it
up carefully with mine and your own now observe in ever doubted until
within this hour or two that he had or could have such a paper it is
good until recalled but it maybe soon recalled and i have reason to
think will be

they are not in danger

they are in great danger they are in danger of denunciation by madame
defarge i know it from her own lips i have overheard words of that
womans tonight which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours i have lost no time and since then i have seen the spy he
confirms me he knows that a wood sawyer living by the prison wall
is under the control of the defarge sand has been rehearsed by
madame defarge as to his having seen her he never mentioned lucie s
name making signs and signals to prisoners it is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one a prison plot and that it will
involve her life and perhaps her childs and perhaps her fathers for
both have been seen with her at that place dont look so horrified you
will save them all

heaven grant i may carton but how

i am going to tell you how it will depend on you and it could depend
on no betterman this new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after tomorrow probably not until two or three days afterwards
more probably a week afterwards you know it is a capital crime to
mourn for or sympathise with a victim of the guillotine she and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime and this woman the
in vet eracy of whose pursuit can not be described would wait to add that
strength to her case and make herself doubly sure you follow me

so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say that for
the moment i lose sight touching the back of the doctors chair even
of this distress

you have money and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made your preparations have been
completed for some days to return to england early tomorrow have your
horses ready so that they maybe in starting trim at two oclock in the
afternoon

it shall be done

his manner was so fervent and inspiring that mr lorry caught the
flame and was as quick as youth

you area noble heart did i say we could depend upon no betterman
tell her tonight what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father dwell upon that for she would lay her own fairhead
beside her husbands cheerfully he faltered for an instant then went
on as before for the sake of her child and her father press upon her
the necessity of leaving paris with them and you at that hour tell
her that it washer husbands last arrangement tell her that more
depends upon it than shed are believe or hope you think that her
father even in this sad state will submit himself to her do you not

i am sure of it

i thought so quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage
the moment i come to you take me in and drive away

i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances

you have my certificate in your hand with the rest you know and will
reserve my place wait for nothing but to have my place occupied and
then for england

why then said mr lorry grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand it does not all depend on one oldman but i shall have a young
and ardent man at my side

by the help of heaven you shall promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
another

nothing carton

remember these words tomorrow change the course or delay in it for
any reason and no life can possibly be saved and many lives must
inevitably be sacrificed

i will remember them i hope to do my part faithfully

and i hope to domine now goodbye

though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness and though he even
put the oldman sh and to his lips he did not part from him then he
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaning ly besought
to have he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it out watched the awful night he entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone looking up at the light in the window of
her room before he went away he breathed a blessing towards it and a
farewell




xiii fifty two


in the black prison of the concierge rie the doomed of the day awaited
their fate they were in number as the weeks of the year fifty two were
to roll that afternoon on the life tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea before their cells were quit of them new occupants
were appointed before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday
the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set
apart

two score and twelve were told off from the farmer general of seventy
whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her physical diseases engendered
in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims of all degrees
and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable suffering
intolerable oppression and heartless indifference smote equally
without distinction

charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal in every line
of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that units could
avail him nothing

nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him to compose his mind to what it must bear his hold on life
was strong and it was very very hard to loosen by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter there and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded
this was closed again there was a hurry too in all his thoughts
a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended against
resignation if for a moment he did feel resigned then his wife and
child who had to live after him seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing

but all this was at first before long the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully and trod it firmly everyday sprang up to stimulate
him next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet fortitude so
by degrees he calmed into the better state when he could raise his
thoughts much higher and draw comfort down

before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had
travelled thusfar on his last way being allowed to purchase the means
of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished

he wrote along letter to lucie showing hertha the had known nothing
of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it from herself
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and uncles
responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read he had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished was the one condition fully intelligible now that
her father had attached to their betrothal and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage he entreated her
for her fathers sake never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper or had had it recalled
to him for the moment or for good by the story of the tower on
that old sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden if he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there and which had been described to all the world he
besought her though he added that he knew it was needless to console
her father by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing and her overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their
dear child head ju red her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her
father

to her father himself he wrote in the same strain but he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care and
he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending

to mr lorry he commended them all and explained his worldly affairs
that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment all was done he never thought of carton his mind was so
full of the others that he never once thought of him

he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out when
he laydown on his straw bed he though the had done with this world

but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining
forms free and happy back in the old house in soho though it had
nothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and light of
hear the was with lucie again and she told him it was all a dream and
he had never gone away a pause of forgetfulness and then he had even
suffered and had comeback to her dead and at peace and yet there
was no difference in him another pause of oblivion and he awoke in the
sombre morning unconscious where he was or what had happened until it
flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death

thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fifty two heads
were to fall and now while he was composed and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his waking
thoughts which was very difficult to master

he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life how
high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he would be
stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would be dyed
red which way his face would be turned whether he would be the first
or might be the last these and many similar questions in nowise
directed by his will obt rude d themselves over and over again countless
times neither were they connected with fear he was conscious of no
fear rather they originated in a strange be setting desire to know what
to do when the time came a desire gigantic ally disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his than his own

the hours went on a she walked to and fro and the clocks struck the
number she would never hear again nine gone forever ten gone for
ever eleven gone forever twelve coming on to pass away after a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him he had got the better of i the walked up and down softly
repeating their names to himself the worst of the strife was over
he could walkup and down free from distracting fancies praying for
himself and for them

twelve gone forever

he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he would
be summoned sometime earlier inasmuch as the tum bril s jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets therefore he resolved to keep two
before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others

walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast a very
different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at la force
he heard one struck away from him without surprise the hour had
measured like most other hours devoutly thankful to heaven for his
recovered self possession he thought there is but another now and
turned to walk again

footsteps in the stone passage outside the door he stopped

the key was putin the lock and turned before the door was opened or
as it opened a man said in a low voice in english he has never seen
me here i have kept out of his way go you in alone i wait near lose
no time

the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him
face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on his
features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for the
first moment the prisoner mis doubted him to bean apparition of his own
imagining but he spoke and it was his voice he took the prisoners
hand and it was his real grasp

of all the people upon earth you least expected to see me he said

i could not believe it to be you i can scarcely believe it now you
are not the apprehension came suddenly into his mind a prisoner

no i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here and in virtue of it i stand before you i come from her your
wife dear darnay

the prisoner wrung his hand

i bring you a request from her

what is it

a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well
remember

the prisoner turned his face partly aside

you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means i have
no time to tell you you must comply with it takeoff those boots you
wear and draw on these of mine

there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisoner
carton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightning got
him down into it and stood over him barefoot

draw on these boots of mine put your hands to them put your will to
them quick

carton there is no escaping from this place it never can be done you
will only die with me it is madness

it would be madness if i asked you to escape but do i when i ask you
to pass out at that door tell me it is madness and remain here change
that cravat for this of mine that coat for this of mine while you do
it let me take this ribbon from your hair and shakeout your hair like
this of mine

with wonderful quickness and with a strength both of will and action
that appeared quite supernatural he forced all these changes upon him
the prisoner was like a young child in his hands

carton dear carton it is madness it can not be accomplished it never
can be done it has been attempted and has always failed i implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine

do i ask you my dear darnay to pass the door when i ask that
refuse there are pen and ink and paper on this table is your hand
steady enough to write

it was when you came in

steady it again and write what i shall dictate quick friend quick

pressing his hand to his bewildered head darnay sat down at the table
carton with his righthand in his breast stood close beside him

write exactly as is peak

to whom do i address it

to no one carton still had his hand in his breast

do i date it

no

the prisoner looked up at each question carton standing over him with
his hand in his breast looked down

if you remember said carton dictating the words that passed
between us long ago you will readily comprehend this when you see it
you do remember them i know it is not in your nature to forget them

he was drawing his hand from his breast the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder a she wrote the hand stopped closing upon
something

have you written forget them carton asked

i have is that a weapon in your hand

no i am not armed

what is it in your hand

you shall know directly write on there are but a few words more he
dictated again i am thankful that the time has come when i can prove
them that i do so is no subject for regret or grief a she said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writers face

the pen dropped from darnay s fingers on the table and he looked about
him vacantly

what vapour is that he asked

vapour

something that crossed me

i am conscious of nothing there can be nothing here take up the pen
and finish hurry hurry

as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention a she looked at carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing carton his
hand again in his breast looked steadily at him

hurry hurry

the prisoner bent over the paper once more

if it had been otherwise cartons hand was again watch fully and
softly stealing down in ever should have used the longer opportunity
if it had been otherwise the hand was at the prisoners face i
should but have had so much the more to answer for if it had been
otherwise carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs

cartons hand moved back to his breast no more the prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look but cartons hand was close and firm a this
nostrils and cartons left arm caught him round the waist for a few
second she faintly struggled with the man who had come to laydown his
life for him but within a minute or so he was stretched insensible on
the ground

quickly but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside combed back
his hair and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn then he
softly called enter there come in and the spy presented himself

you see said carton looking up a she kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure putting the paper in the breast is your hazard very
great

mr carton the spy answered with a timid snap of his fingers my
hazard is not that in the thick of business here if you are true to
the whole of your bargain

dont fear me i will be true to the death

you must be mr carton if the tale of fifty two is to be right being
made right by you in that dress i shall have no fear

have no fear i shall soon be out of the way of harming you and the
rest will soon be far from here please god now get assistance and
take me to the coach

you said the spy nervously

him man with whom i have exchanged you go out at the gate by which
you brought me in

of course

i was weak and faint when you brought me in and i am fainter now you
take me out the parting interview has overpowered me such a thing has
happened here often and too often your life is in your own hands
quick call assistance

you swear not to betray me said the trembling spy a she paused for a
last moment

man man returned carton stamping his foot have is worn by no
solemn vow already to go through with this that you waste the precious
moments now take him yourself to the courtyard you know of place
him yourself in the carriage show him yourself to mr lorry tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air and to remember my words of
last night and his promise of last night and drive away

the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his
forehead on his hands the spy returned immediately with t women

how then said one of them contemplating the fallen figure so
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
sainte guillotine

a good patriot said the other could hardly have been more afflicted
if the aristocrat had drawn a blank

they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door and bent to carry it away

the time is short ev re monde said the spy in a warning voice

i know it well answered carton be careful of my friend i entreat
you and leave me

come then my children said bars ad lift him and come away

the door closed and carton was left alone straining his powers of
listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm there was none keys turned doors clashed
footsteps passed along distant passages no cry was raised or hurry
made that seemed unusual breathing more freely in a little while he
sat down at the table and listened again until the clocks truck two

sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then
began to be audible several doors were opened in succession and
finally his own a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in merely
saying follow me ev re monde and he followed into a large darkroom
at a distance it was a dark winter day and what with the shadows
within and what with the shadows without he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound some were
standing some seated some were lamenting and in restless motion
but these were few the great majority were silent and still looking
fixedly at the ground

a she stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fifty two
were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace him
as having a knowledge of him it thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery but the man went on a very few moments after that a young
woman with as light girlish form a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes rose from
these at where he had observed her sitting and came to speak to him

citizen ev re monde she said touching him with her cold hand i am a
poor little seamstress who was with you in la force

he murmured for answer true i forget what you were accused of

plots though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any is it
likely who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me

the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tears
started from his eyes

i am not afraid to die citizen ev re monde but i have done nothing i
am not unwilling to die if the republic which is to do so much good
to us poor will profit by my death but i do not know how that can be
citizen ev re monde such a poor weak little creature

as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl

i heard you were released citizen ev re monde i hoped it was true

it was but i was again taken and condemned

if i may ride with you citizen ev re monde will you let me hold your
hand i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will give me
more courage

as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in
them and then astonishment he pressed the work worn hunger worn young
fingers and touched his lips

are you dying for him she whispered

and his wife and child hush yes

o you will let me hold your brave hand stranger

hush yes my poor sister to the last



the same shadows that are falling on the prison are falling in that
same hour of the early afternoon on the barrier with the crowd about
it when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined

who goes here whom have we within papers

the papers are handed out and read

alexandre manette physician french which is he

this is he this helpless in articulately murmuring wandering oldman
pointed out

apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind the
revolution fever will have been too much for him

greatly too much for him

hah many suffer with it lucie his daughter french which is she

this is she

apparently it must be lucie the wife of ev re monde is it not

it is

ha he vre monde has an assignation elsewhere lucie her child english
this is she

she and no other

kiss me child of ev re monde now thou hast kissed a good republican
something new in thy family remember it sydney carton advocate
english which is he

he lies herein this corner of the carriage he too is pointed out

apparently the english advocate is in a swoon

it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air it is represented that
he is not in strong health and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the republic

is that all it is not a great deal that many are under the
displeasure of the republic and must lookout at the little window
jarvis lorry banker english which is he

i am he necessarily being the last

it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions it
is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door replying to a group of officials they leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof the country people hanging about press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in a little child carried by its
mother has its short arm held out for it that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine

behold your papers jarvis lorry countersigned

one can depart citizen

one can depart forward my postilion sa good journey

i salute you citizens and the first danger passed

these are again the words of jarvis lorry a she clasps his hands and
looks upward there is terror in the carriage there i sweeping there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller

are we not going too slowly can they not be induced to go faster
asks lucie clinging to the oldman

it would seem like flight my darling i must not urge them too much
it would rouse suspicion

look back look back and see if we are pursued

the road is clear my dearest so far we are not pursued

houses in two sand three spass by us solitary farms ruinous buildings
dye works tanneries and the like open country avenues of leafless
trees the hard uneven pavement is under us the soft deep mud is on
either side sometimes we strike into the skirting mud to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us sometimes we stick in ruts and
sloughs there the agony of our impatience is then so great that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are forgetting out and running hiding doing
anything but stopping

out of the open country in again among ruinous buildings solitary
farms dye works tanneries and the like cottages in two sand threes
avenues of leafless trees have these men deceived us and taken us back
by another road is not this the same place twice over thank heaven
no a village look back look back and see if we are pursued hush
the posting house

leisurely our four horses are taken out leisurely the coach stands in
the little street bereft of horses and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again leisurely the new horses come into visible
existence one by one leisurely the new postilion s follow sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips leisurely the old postilion scount
their money make wrong additions and arrive at dissatisfied results
all the time our over fraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled

at length the new postilion s are in their saddles and the old are left
behind we are through the village up the hill and down the hill and
on the low watery grounds suddenly the postilion sex change speech with
animated gest i culation and the horses are pulled up almost on their
haunches we are pursued

ho within the carriage there speak then

what is i tasks mr lorry looking out at window

how many did they say

i do not understand you

at the last post how many to the guillotine today

fifty two

i said so a brave number my fellow citizen here would have it
forty two ten more heads are worth having the guillotine goes
handsomely i love it hi forward whoop

the night comes on dark he moves more he is beginning to revive and
to speak intelligibly he thinks they are still together he asks him
by his name what he has in his hand o pity us kind heaven and help
us look outlook out and see if we are pursued

the wind is rushing after us and the clouds are flying after us and
the moon is plunging after us and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us but so far we are pursued by nothing else




xiv the knitting done


in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury not in the wine shop did madame
defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the wood sawyer
erst a mender of roads the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference but abide data little distance like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required or to offer an opinion until invited

but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good
republican eh

there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes in france

peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with
as light frown on her lieutenant slips hear me speak my husband
fellow citizen is a good republican and a bold man he has deserved
well of the republic and possesses its confidence but my husband has
his weaknesses and he is so weak a store lent towards this doctor

it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his head
with his cruel fingers a this hungry mouth it is not quite like a good
citizen it is a thing to regret

see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i he may wear
his head or lose it for any interest i have in him it is all one to
me but the ev re monde people are to be exterminated and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father

she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three i have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson held
them up ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure

madame defarge cast down here yes and reflected a little

the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment
of his words has golden hair and blue eyes and we seldom have a child
there it is a pretty sight

in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction
i can not trust my husband in this matter not only do i feel since
last night that id are not confide to him the details of my projects
but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning
and then they might escape

that must never be croaked jacques three no one must escape we
have not half enough as it is we ought to have six score a day

in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation and i have no this reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility i must act for myself
therefore come hither little citizen

the wood sawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the
submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his redcap

touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly
that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day

a yay why not cried the sawyer everyday in all weathers from
two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one sometimes
without i know what i know i have seen with my eyes

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen

clearly plots said jacques three transparently

there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile

rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizen essi answer for my
fellow jury men

now let me see said madame defarge pondering again yet once more
can i spare this doctor to my husband i have no feeling either way can
i spare him

he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice
we really have not heads enough it would be a pity i think

he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge i
can not speak of one without the other and i must not be silent and
trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here for i am not a
bad witness

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be a
celestial witness

he must take his chance said madame defarge no i can not spare
him you are engaged at three oclock you are going to see the batch of
today executed you

the question was addressed to the wood sawyer who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been
suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of madame defarge s head of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety every hour in the day

i said madame am equally engaged at the same place after it is
over say at eight tonight come you to me in saint antoine and we
will give information against these people at my section

the wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizen ess the citizen ess looking at him he became embarrassed evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among his wood and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw

madame defarge beckoned the jury man and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door and there expounded her further views to them thus

she will now beat home awaiting the moment of his death she will
be mourning and grieving she will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the republic she will be full of sympathy with its enemies
i willgoto her

what an admirable woman what an adorable woman exclaimed jacques
three rapturously ah my cherished cried the vengeance and
embraced her

take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her
lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat keep
me my usual chair go you there straight for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual today

i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with
alacrity and kissing her cheek you will not be late

i shall be there before the commencement

and before the tum bril s arrive be sure you are there my soul said
the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the
street before the tum bril s arrive

madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the
mud and round the corner of the prison wall the vengeance and the
jury man looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative
of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments

there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the streets of a
strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great
determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities the troubled time would have
heaved her up under any circumstances but imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong and an inveterate hatred of a class
opportunity had developed her into a tigress she was absolutely without
pity if she had ever had the virtue inherit had quite gone out of
her

it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers she saw not him but them it was nothing to her that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan that was
insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies and
her prey and as such had no right to live to appeal to her was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself if she had
been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself nor if she had
been ordered to the axe tomorrow would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe carelessly
worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse redcap lying hidden in her
bosom was a loaded pistol lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened
dagger thus acc out red and walking with the confident tread of such
a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood barefoot and bare legged on the brown
seas and madame defarge took her way along the streets

now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last night
the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr lorry s
attention it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers should be reduced to the utmost since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there
finally he had proposed after anxious consideration that miss pross
and jerry who were at liberty to leave the city should leave it at
three oclock in the lightest wheeled conveyance known to that period
unencumbered with luggage they would soon overtake the coach and
passing it and preceding it on the road would order its horses in
advance and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night when delay was the most to be dreaded

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy she and jerry had
beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge
taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the
else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation

now what do you think mr cruncher said miss pross whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or move or live
what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard another
carriage having already gone from here today it might awaken
suspicion

my opinion miss returned mr cruncher is as you re right likewise
wo till standby you right or wrong

i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures said
miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any plan are
you capable of forming any plan my dear good mr cruncher

respect in a future spear o life miss returned mr cruncher i
hope so respect in any present use o this here blessed old head o
mine i think not would you dome the favour miss to take notice o
two promises and wow swot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis

oh for gracious sake cried miss pross still wildly crying record
them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man

first said mr cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this never no
more will i do it never no more

i am quite sure mr cruncher returned miss pross that you
never will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is

no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you second them
poor things well out o this and never no more will i interfere with
mrs crunchers flopping never no more

whatever housekeeping arrangement that maybe said miss pross
striving to dry here yes and compose herself i have no doubt it
is best that mrs cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence o my poor darlings

i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded mr cruncher with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit and let my words
be took down and took to mrs cruncher through yourself that wot my
opinions respect in flopping has undergone a change and that wot i only
hope with all my heart as mrs cruncher maybe a flopping at the present
time

there there there i hope she is my dearman cried the distracted
miss pros sandi hope she finds it answering her expectations

forbid it proceeded mr cruncher with additional solemnity
additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wi site don my
earnest wishes for them poor cree tur snow forbid it as we shouldnt all
flop if it was anyways con we nient to get e mou to this here dismal
risk forbid it miss wot i say forbid it this was mr crunchers
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one

and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
nearer and nearer

if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may rely
upon my telling mrs cruncher as much as i maybe able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said and at all events
you maybe sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time now pray let us think my esteemed mr
cruncher let us think

still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer
and nearer

if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me wouldnt
that be best

mr cruncher thought it might be best

where could you wait for me asked miss pross

mr cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed

by the cathedral door said miss pross would it be much out of
the way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two
towers

no miss answered mr cruncher

then like the best of men said miss pross goto the posting house
straight and make that change

i am doubtful said mr cruncher hesitating and shaking his head
about leaving of you you see we dont know what may happen

heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for me
take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as you can
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here i feel certain
of it there bless you mr cruncher think not of me but of the lives
that may depend on both of us

this exordium and miss pros ss two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his decided mr cruncher with an encouraging nod or two he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution was a great relief to miss pross the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets was another relief she looked at her watch and it was twenty
minutes past two she had no time to lose but must get ready at once

afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms and of half imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them miss pross got a basin of coldwater and began lavin g here yes
which were swollen and red haunted by her feverish apprehensions she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out for she saw a figure standing in the room

the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge by strange stern ways and through much staining blood
those feet had come to meet that water

madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of ev re monde
where is she

it flashed upon miss pros ss mind that the doors were all standing open
and would suggest the flight her first act was to shut them there were
four in the room and she shut them all she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied

madame defarge s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement
and rested on her when it was finished miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness
of her appearance but she too was a determined woman in her different
way and she measured madame defarge with here yes every inch

you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss
pross in her breathing nevertheless you shall not get the better of
meia man englishwoman

madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of
miss pros ss own perception that they two were at bay she saw a tight
hard wiry woman before her as mr lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand in the years gone by she knew full well that
miss pross was the family s devoted friend miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the family s malevolent enemy

on my way yonder said madame defarge with as light movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing i
wish to see her

i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may
depend upon i till hold my own against them

each spoke in her own language neither understood the others words
both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner what
the unintelligible words meant

it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from meat this
moment said madame defarge good patriots will know what that means
let me see her go tell her that i wish to see her do you hear

if those eyes of yours were bed winches returned miss pros sandi
was an english four poster they shouldnt loose a splinter of me no
you wicked foreign woman i am your match

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught

woman imbecile and pig like said madame defarge frowning i take no
answer from you i demand to see her either tell her that i demand
to see her or standout of the way of the door and let me goto her
this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm

i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language but i would give all i have
except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or any
part of it

neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her but she now advanced one step

i am a briton said miss pros siam desperate i dont care an
english twopence for myself i know that the longer i keep you here the
greater hope there is for my ladybird ill not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me

thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of here yes
between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath
thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life

but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into here yes this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness haha she
laughed you poor wretch what are you worth i address myself to that
doctor then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor wife
of ev re monde child of ev re monde any person but this miserable fool
answer the citizen ess defarge

perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss pros ss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone
three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in

those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing there
are odds and ends upon the ground there is no one in that room behind
you let me look

never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer

if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and
brought back said madame defarge to herself

as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you are
uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself and you shall not
know that if i can prevent your knowing it and know that or not know
that you shall not leave here while i can hold you

i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me
i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said
madame defarge

we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard we are
not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here
while every minute youarehere is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling said miss pross

madame defarge made at the door miss pros son the instinct of the
moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her tight
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike miss pross
with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate
clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and to re her
face but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman

soon madame defarge shands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled
waist it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered tones you
shall not draw it i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies

madame defarge shands were at her bosom miss pross looked up saw
what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood
alone blinded with smoke

all this was in a second as the smoke cleared leaving an awful
stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay life lesson the ground

in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help happily she be thought herself of the consequences of
what she did in time to check herself and go back it was dreadful to
go in at the door again but she did go in and even went near it to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear these she put on
out on the staircase first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry and then got up and hurried away

by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped by good fortune too she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman she needed both advantages for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was torn and her
dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and waiting there
she thought what if the key were already taken in a net what if
it were identified what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to prison and
charged with murder in the midst of these fluttering thoughts the
escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross could
not hear him so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher amazed at
all events shell see that and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pros sas if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she a in tina queer condition said mr cruncher more and
more disturbed wot can she have been at akin to keep her courage up
hark theres the roll of them dreadful carts you can hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her nothing o
my goodman there was first a great crash and then a great stillness
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable never to be
broken anymore as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful cart snow very nigh their
journey send said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder its my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world

and indeed she never did




xv the footsteps die out forever


along the paris streets the death carts rumble hollow and harsh six
tum bril scarry the days wine to la guillotine all the devouring and
insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself
a refused in the one realisation guillotine and yet there is not in
france with its rich variety of soil and climate a blade a leaf
a root asp riga peppercorn which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror crush
humanity out of shape once more under similar hammers and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind

six tum bril s roll along the streets change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs the equip ages of feudal nobles the
toilettes of flaring jezebel s the churches that are not my fathers
house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving peasants
no the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the creator never reverses his transformations if thou be changed
into this shape by the will of god say the seers to the enchanted in
the wise arabian stories then remain so but if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration then resume thy former aspect
change less and hopeless the tum bril s roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough up
along crooked furrow among the populace in the streets ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go steadily onward
so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle that
in many windows there are no people and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended while the eyes survey the faces in
the tum bril s here and there the inmate has visitors to see the sight
then he points his finger with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent to this cart and to this and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday and who there the day before

of the riders in the tum bril s some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heed ful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres and in pictures several close their eyes
and think or try to get their straying thoughts together only one and
he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so shattered and made
drunk by horror that he sings and tries to dance not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture to the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tum bril s
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked some
question it would seem to be always the same question for it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart the
horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it with
their swords the leading curiosity is to know which is hehe stands
at the back of the tum bril with his head bent down to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart and holds his hand he has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him and always speaks to the
girl here and there in the longstreet of st honore cries are raised
against him if they move him at all it is only to a quiet smile a she
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face he can not easily
touch his face his arms being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the coming up of the tum bril s stands
the spy and prison sheep he looks into the first of them not there
he looks into the second not there he already asks himself has he
sacrificed me when his face clears a she looks into the third

which is ev re monde says a man behind him

that at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down ev re monde to the guillotine all aristocrats
down ev re monde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit it will be paid in five minutes more
let him beat peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down ev re monde the face of
ev re monde is for a moment turned towards him ev re monde then sees the
spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution and
end the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden of
public diversion area number of women busily knitting on one of the
foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones who has seen her therese
defarge

she never missed before says a knitting woman of the sisterhood

non or will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly therese

louder the woman recommends

ay louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
the e louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messenger shaved one dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair and
here are the tum bril san dev re monde will be despatched in a wink and
she not here see her knitting in my hand and her empty chair ready for
her i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tum bril s
begin to discharge their loads the ministers of sainte guillotine are
robed and ready crash ahead is held up and the knitting women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak count one

the second tum bril empties and moves on the third comes up crash and
the knitting women never faltering or pausing in their work count two

the suppose dev re monde descends and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out but
still holds it a she promised he gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirr sup and falls and she looks into
his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today i think you were sent to me by
heaven

or you to me says sydney carton keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand i shall mind nothing when i let
it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid fear not

the two stand in the fast thinning throng of victims but they speak as
if they were alone eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand heart to
heart these two children of the universal mother else so wide apart
and differing have come together on the dark highway to repair home
together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last question i
am very ignorant and it troubles me just a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly she is five years younger than i and she lives in a
farmers house in the south country poverty parted us and sheknows
nothing of my fate for i can not write and if i could how should i
tell her it is better as it is

yes yes better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking no was i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is this if the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in allways to suffer less she may
live along time she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and tremble
that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the better land
where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it can not be my child there is no time there and no trouble there

you comfort me so much i am so ignorant am i to kiss you now is the
moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble a she releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face she goes next before
him is gone the knitting women count twenty two

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth
in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the up turning of many faces the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd so that its wells
forward in a mass like one great heave of water all flashes away
twenty three



they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peace fullest mans face ever beheld there many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe a woman had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her if he had given any
utterance to his and they were prophetic they would have been these

i see bars ad and clyde farge the vengeance the jury man the judge
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old perishing by this retributive instrument before it shall cease
out of its present use i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss and in their struggles to be truly free in
their triumphs and defeats through long years to come i see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i laydown my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more i see
her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name i see her father
aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all men in his
healing office and at peace i see the good oldman so long their
friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has and passing
tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence i see her an old woman weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day i see her and her husband their
course done lying side by side in their last earthly bed and i know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the others soul
than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who layup on her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine i see him
winning it so well that my name is made illustrious thereby the
light of his i see the blots i threw upon it faded away i see him
foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my name
with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place then fair to
lookup on with not at race of this days disfigurement and i hear him
tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering voice

it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a
far far better rest that i goto than i have ever known

the ras send y lls with a word on the elph bergs


i wonder when in the world you re going to do anything rudolf said
my brothers wife

my dear rose i answered laying down my egg spoon why in the world
should i do anything my position is a comfortable one i have an
income nearly sufficient for my wants no ones income is ever quite
sufficient you know i enjoy an enviable social position i am
brother to lord burle sd on and brother in law to that charming lady his
countess behold it is enough

you are nine and twenty she observed and youve done nothing but

knockabout it is true our family doesnt need to do things

this remark of mine rather annoyed rose for everybody knows and
therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact that pretty
and accomplished as she herself is her family is hardly of the same
standing as the ras send y lls besides her attractions she possessed a
large fortune and my brother robert was wise enough not to mind about
her ancestry ancestry is in fact a matter concerning which the next
observation of roses has some truth

good families are generally worse than any others she said

upon this i stroked my hair i knew quite well what she meant

im so glad roberts is black she cried

at this moment robert who rises at seven and works before breakfast
came in he glanced a this wife her cheek was slightly flushed he
patted it caressingly

whats the matter my dear he asked

she objects to my doing nothing and having redhair said i in an
injured tone

oh of course he cant help his hair admitted rose

it generally crops out once in a generation said my brother so does
the nose rudolf has got them both

i wish they didnt crop out said rose still flushed

i rather like them myself said i and rising i bowed to the
portrait of countess amelia

my brothers wife uttered an exclamation of impatience

i wish you d take that picture away robert said she

my dear he cried

good heavens i added

then it might be forgotten she continued

hardly with rudolf about said robert shaking his head

why should it be forgotten i asked

rudolf exclaimed my brothers wife blushing very prettily

i laughed and went on with my egg atleast i had shelved the question
of what if anything i ought to do and by way of closing the
discussion and also i must admit of exasperating my strict little
sister in law at rifle more i observed

i rather like being an elph berg myself

when i read a story i skip the explanations yet the moment i begin to
write one i find that i must have an explanation for it is manifest
that i must explain why my sister in law was vexed with my nose and
hair and why i ventured to call myself an elph berg for eminent as
i must protest the ras send y lls have been for many generations yet
participation in their blood of course does not at first sight justify
the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the elph bergs or
a claim to be one of that royal house for what relationship is there
between ruritan i a and burle sd on between the palace at str elsa u or the
castle of zenda and number park la new

well then and i must premise that i am going perforce to rake up the
very scandal which my dear lady burle sd on wishes forgotten in the year
george ii sitting the non the throne peace reigning for
the moment and the king and the prince of wales being not yet at
loggerheads there came on a visit to the english court a certain
prince who was afterwards known to history as rudolf the third of
ruritan i a the prince was at all handsome young fellow marked maybe
marred it is not for me to say by a somewhat unusually long sharp and
straight nose and a mass of darkred hair in fact the nose and the
hair which have stamped the elph bergs timeout of mind he stayed some
months in england where he was most courteously received yet in
the end he left rather under a cloud for he fought a duel it was
considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank
with a nobleman well known in the society of the day not only for his
own merits but as the husband of a very beautiful wife in that duel
prince rudolf received a severe wound and recovering there from was
adroitly smuggled off by the ruritan ian ambassador who had found him
a pretty handful the nobleman was not wounded in the duel but the
morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting he contracted
a severe chill and failing to throw it off he died some six months
after the departure of prince rudolf without having found leisure to
adjust his relations with his wife who after another two months bore
an heir to the title and estates of the family of burle sd on this lady
was the countess amelia whose picture my sister in law wished to remove
from the drawing room in parklane and her husband was james fifth
earl of burle sd on and twenty second baron ras send yll both in the
peerage of england and a knight of the garter as for rudolf he went
back to ruritan i a married a wife and ascended the throne where on his
progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour with
one short interval and finally if you walkthrough the picture
galleries at burle sd on among the fifty portraits or so of the last
century and a half you will find five or six including that of the
sixth earl distinguished by long sharp straight noses and a quantity
of darkred hair these five or six have also blue eyes whereas among
the ras send y lls dark eyes are the commoner

that is the explanation and i am glad to have finished it the
blemishes on honourable lineage area delicate subject and certainly
this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandal monger in the
world it laughs at discretion and writes strange entries between the
lines of the peerages

it will be observed that my sister in law with a want of logic that
must have been peculiar to herself since we are no longer allowed to
lay it to the charge of her sex treated my complexion almost as an
offence for which i was responsible hastening to assume from that
external sign inward qualities of which i protest my entire innocence
and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the
uselessness of the life i had led well be that as it may i had picked
up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge i had been to
a german school and a german university and spoke german as readily
and perfectly as english i was thoroughly at home in french i had a
smattering of italian and enough spanish to swear by i was i believe
a strong though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot i could ride
anything that had a back to sit on and my head was as cool a one as you
could find for all its flaming cover if you say that i ought to have
spent my time in useful labour i am out of court and have nothing
to say save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand
pounds a year and a roving disposition

the difference between you and robert said my sister in law who
often bless her speaks on a platform and oftener still as if she
were on one is that he recognizes the duties of his position and you
see the opportunities of yours

to a man of spirit my dear rose i answered opportunities are
duties

nonsense said she tossing her head and after a moment she went on
nowhere s sir jacob b or rod a ile offering you exactly what you might be
equal to

a thousand thanks i murmured

hes to have an embassy in six months and robert says he is sure that
hell take you as an attached o take it rudolf to please me

now when my sister in law puts the matter in that way wrinkling her
pretty brows twisting her little hands and growing wistful in the
eyes all on account of an idle scamp like myself for whom she has
no natural responsibility i am visited with compunction moreover i
thought it possible that i could pass the time in the position suggested
with some tolerable amusement therefore i said

my dear sister if in six months time no unforeseen obstacle has
arisen and sir jacob invites me hang me if i dont go with sir jacob

oh rudolf how good of you i am glad

where she going to

he doesnt know yet but its sure to be a good embassy

madame said i for your sake ill go if its no more than a
beggarly legation when i do a thing i dont do it by halves

my promise then was given but six months are six months and see man
eternity and inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective
industry i suppose attaches are industrious but i know not for i
never became attache to sir jacob or anybody else i cast about for
some desirable mode of spending them and it occurred to me suddenly
that i would visit ruritan i a it may seem strange that i had never
visited that country yet but my father inspite of a sneaking fondness
for the elph bergs which led him to give me his seconds on the famous
elph berg name of rudolf had always been averse from my going and
since his death my brother prompted by rose had accepted the family
tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that
country but the moment ruritan i a had come into my head i was eaten up
with a curiosity to see it after all redhair and long noses are
not confined to the house of elph berg and the old story seemed
a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from
acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom one which
had played no small part in european history and might do the like
again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler such as the new
king was rumoured to be my determination was clinched by reading in the
times that rudolf the fifth was to be crowned at str elsa u in the course
of the next three weeks and that great magnificence was to mark
the occasion at once i made up my mind to be present and began my
preparations but inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish
my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case i
anticipated opposition to my wishes i gave out that i was going for a
ramble in the tyrol an old haunt of mine and propitiated roses wrath
by declaring that i intended to study the political and social problems
of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood

perhaps i hinted darkly there maybe an outcome of the expedition

what do you means he asked

well said i carelessly there seems a gap that might be filled by an
exhaustive work on

oh will you write a books he cried clapping her hands that would
be splendid wouldnt it robert

its the best of introductions to political life nowadays observed my
brother who has by the way introduced himself in this manner several
times over bur les do non ancient theories and modern facts and the
ultimate outcome by a political student are both works of recognized
eminence

i believe you are right bob my boy said i

now promise youll do it said rose earnestly

no i wont promise but if i find enough material i will

thats fair enough said robert

oh material doesnt matters he said pouting

but this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me
to tell the truth i would have wagered a handsome sum that the story
of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single
pen and that show show little we know what the future holds for here i
am fulfilling my qualified promise and writing as in ever thought
to write a book though it will hardly serve as an introduction to
political life and has not a jotto do with the tyrol

neither would it i fear please lady burle sd on if i were to submit it
to her critical eye a step which i have no intention of taking




chapter

concerning the colour of mens hair


it was a maxim of my uncle williams that no man should passthrough
paris without spending four and twenty hours there my uncle spoke out
of a ripe experience of the world and i honoured his advice by putting
up for a day and a night at the continental on my way to the tyrol
i called on george featherly at the embassy and we had abit of dinner
together at durand sand afterwards dropped into the opera and
after that we had a little supper and after that we called on bertram
bertrand a versi fier of some repute and paris correspondent to the
critic he had a very comfortable suite of rooms and we found some
pleasant fellows smoking and talking it struck me however that
bertram himself was absent and in low spirits and when everybody except
ourselves had gone i rallied him on his moping preoccupation he
fenced with me for a while but at last flinging himself on as of a he
exclaimed

very well have it your own way i am in love infernal lyin love

oh youll write the better poetry said i by way of consolation

he ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously george
featherly standing with his back to the mantelpiece smiled unkindly

if its the old affairs aid he you may as well throw it up bert
shes leaving paris tomorrow

i know that snapped bertram

not that it would make any difference if she stayed pursued the
relentless george she flies higher than the paper trade my boy

hang her said bertram

it would make it more interesting for me i ventured to observe if i
knew who you were talking about

antoinette mau ban said george

dem au ban growled bertram

oho said i passing by the question of the de you dont mean to
say bert

cant you let me alone

where s she going to i asked for the lady was something of a
celebrity

george jingled his money smiled cruelly at poor bertram and answered
pleasantly

nobody knows by the way berti meta great man at her house the
other night atleast about a month ago did you ever meet him the
duke of str elsa u

yes i did growled bertram

an extremely accomplished man i thought him

it was not hard to see that georges references to the duke were
intended to aggravate poor bertrams sufferings so that i drew the
inference that the duke had distinguished madame dem au ban by his
attentions she was a widow rich handsome and according to repute
ambitious it was quite possible that she as george put it was flying
as high as a personage who was everything he could be short of enjoying
strictly royal rank for the duke was the son of the late king of
ruritan i a by a second and morgan atic marriage and half brother to the
new king he had been his fathers favourite and it had occasioned
some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke with a title
derived from no less a city than the capital itself his mother had been
of good but not exalted birth

hes not in paris now is he i asked

ohno hes gone back to be present at the kings coronation a
ceremony which i should say hell not enjoy much but bertold man
dont despair he wont marry the fair antoinette atleast not unless
another plan comes to nothing still perhaps she he paused and added
with a laugh royal attentions are hard to resist you know that dont
you rudolf

confound you said i and rising i left the hapless bertram in
georges hands and went home to bed

the next day george featherly went with me to the station where i took
a ticket for dresden

going to see the pictures asked george with a grin

george is an inveterate gossip and had it old him that i was off to
ruritan i a the news would have been in london in three days and in park
lane in a week i was therefore about to return an evasive answer
when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across
the platform following him with my eyes i saw him lift his hat and
ac costa graceful fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from
the booking office she was perhaps a year or two over thirty tall
dark and of rather full figure as george talked i saw her glance at
me and my vanity was hurt by the thought that muffled in a fur coat
and a neck wrapper for it was a chilly april day and wearing a soft
travelling hat pulled down tom years i must be looking very far from
my best a moment later george rejoined me

youve got a charming travelling companion he said thats poor bert
bertrand s goddess antoinette dem au ban and like you shes going to
dresden also no doubt to see the pictures its very queer though
that she doesnt at present desire the honour of your acquaintance

i didnt ask to be introduced i observed a little annoyed

well i offered to bring you to her but she said another time
nevermind old fellow perhaps there ll be a smash and youll have a
chance of rescuing her and cutting out the duke of str elsa u

no smash however happened either to me or to madame dem au bani can
speak for her as confidently as for myself for when after a nights
rest in dresden i continued my journey she got into the same train
understanding that she wished to be let alone i avoided her carefully
but i saw that she went the same way as i did to the very end of my
journey and i took opportunities of having a good look at her when i
could do so unobserved

as soon as we reached the ruritan ian frontier where the old officer who
presided over the customhouse favoured me with such a stare that i felt
surer than before of my elph berg physiognomy i bought the papers and
found in them news which affected my movements for some reason which
was not clearly explained and seemed to be something of a mystery the
date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced and the ceremony was
to take place on the next day but one the whole country seemed in a
stir about it and it was evident that str elsa u was thronged rooms were
all let and hotels overflowing there would be very little chance of my
obtaining a lodging and i should certainly have to pay an exorbitant
charge for it i made up my mind to stop at zenda a smalltown fifty
miles short of the capital and about ten from the frontier my train
reached there in the evening i would spend the next day tuesday in a
wander over the hills which were said to be very fine and in taking
a glance at the famous castle and go over by train to str elsa u on the
wednesday morning returning at night to sleep at zenda

accordingly at zenda i got out and as the train passed where i stood on
the platform i saw my friend madame dem au ban in her place clearly she
was going through to str elsa u having with more providence than i could
boast secured apartments there i smiled to think how surprised
george featherly would have been to know that she and i had been fellow
travellers for so long

i was very kindly received at the hotel it was really no more than an
inn kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters they were good
quiet people and seemed very little interested in the great doing sat
str elsa u the old ladys hero was the duke for he was now under the
late kings will master of the zenda estates and of the castle which
rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so
from the inn the old lady indeed did not hesitate to express regret
that the duke was not on the throne instead of his brother

we know duke michael said she he has always lived among use very
ruritan ian knows duke michael but the king is almost a stranger he has
been so much abroad not one in ten knows him even by sight

and now chimed in one of the young women they say he has shaved off
his beard so that no one at all knows him

shaved his beard exclaimed her mother who says so

johann the dukes keeper he has seen the king

ah yes the kings iris now at the dukes hunting lodge in the
forest here from here he goes to st rels auto be crowned on wednesday
morning

i was interested to hear this and made up my mind to walk next day in
the direction of the lodge on the chance of coming across the king the
old lady ran on garrulous ly

a hand i wish he would stay a this hunting that and wine and one
thing more are all he loves they say and suffer our duke to be
crowned on wednesday that i wish and i dont care who knows it

hush mother urged the daughters

oh theres many to think as i do cried the old woman stubbornly

i threw myself back in my deep armchair and laughed at her zeal

for my part said the younger and prettier of the two daughters a
fair buxom smiling wench i hate black michael are delph berg for
me mother the king they say is as red as a fox or as

and she laughed mischievously as she cast a glance at me and tossed her
head at her sisters reproving face

many a man has cursed their redhair before now muttered the old
lady and i remembered james fifth earl of burle sd on

but never a woman cried the girl

ay and women when it was too late was the stern answer reducing
the girl to silence and blushes

how comes the king here i asked to break an embarrassed silence it
is the dukes land here you say

the duke invited him sir to rest here till wednesday the duke is at
str elsa u preparing the kings reception

then they re friends

none better said the old lady

but my rosy damsel tossed her head again she was not to be repressed
for long and she broke out again

ay they love one another as men do who want the same place and the
same wife

the old woman glowered but the last words pricked my curiosity and i
interposed before she could begin scolding

what the same wife too how s that young lady

all the world knows that black michael well then mother the
duke would give his soul to marry his cousin the princess flavia and
that she is to be the queen

upon my word said ii begin to be sorry for your duke but if a man
will be a younger son why he must take what the elder leaves and be
as thankful to god a she can and thinking of myself i shrugged my
shoulders and laughed and then i thought also of antoinette dem au ban
and her journey to str elsa u

its little dealing black michael has with began the girl braving
her mothers anger but as she spoke a heavy step sounded on the floor
and a gruff voice asked in a threatening tone

who talks of black michael in his highness sown burgh

the girl gave a little shriek half off right half i think of
amusement

youll not tell of me johann she said

see where your chatter leads said the old lady

the man who had spoken came forward

we have company johann said my hostess and the fellow plucked off
his capa moment later he saw me and to my amazement he started back
a step as though he had seen something wonderful

what ails you johann asked the elder girl this is a gentleman on
his travels come to see the coronation

the man had recovered himself but he was staring at me with an intense
searching almost fierce glance

good evening to you said i

good evening sir he muttered still scrutinizing me and the merry
girl began to laugh as she called

see johann it is the colour you love he started to see your hair
sir its not the colour we see most of herein zenda

i crave your pardon sir stammered the fellow with puzzled eyes i
expected to see no one

give him a glass to drink my health in and ill bid you goodnight
and thanks to you ladies for your courtesy and pleasant conversation

so speaking i rose to my feet and with as light bow turned to the
door the younggirl ran to light me on the way and the man fell back
to let me pass his eyes still fixed on me the moment i was by he
started a step forward asking

pray sir do you know our king

in ever saw him said ii hope to do soon wednesday

he said no more but if el this eyes following me till the door closed
behind me my saucy conductor looking over her shoulder at me as she
preceded me upstairs said

theres no pleasing master johann for one of your colour sir

he prefers yours maybe i suggested

i meant sir in a man she answered with a coquettish glance

what asked i taking hold of the other side of the candlestick does
colour matter in a man

nay but i love yours its the elph berg red

colour in a man said i is a matter of no more moment than
that and i gave her something of no value

godsend the kitchen door be shut said she

a men said i and left her

in fact however as i now know colour is sometimes of considerable
moment to a man




chapter

a merry evening with a distant relative


i was not so unreasonable as to be prejudiced against the dukes keeper
because he disliked my complexion and if i had been his most civil
and obliging conduct as it seemed to me to be next morning would have
disarmed me hearing that i was bound for str elsa u he came to see
me while i was breakfasting and told me that a sister of his who had
married a well to do tradesman and lived in the capital had invited
him to occupy a room in her house he had gladly accepted but now found
that his duties would not permit of his absence he begged therefore
that if such humble though a she added clean and comfortable
lodgings would satisfy me i would take his place he pledged his
sisters acquiescence and urged the inconvenience and crowding to which
i should be subject in my journeys to and from str elsa u the next day
i accepted his offer without a moments hesitation and he went off to
telegraph to his sister while i packed up and prepared to take the next
train but i still hanke red after the forest and the hunting lodge and
when my little maid told me that i could by walking ten miles or so
through the forest hit the railway at a roadside station i decided to
send my luggage direct to the address which johann had given take my
walk and follow to str elsa u myself johann had gone off and was not
aware of the change in my plans but as its only effect was to delay
my arrival a this sisters for a few hours there was no reason for
troubling to inform him of it doubtless the good lady would waste no
anxiety on my account

i took a nearly luncheon and having bidden my kind entertainers
farewell promising to return to the mon my way home i set out to climb
the hill that led to the castle and thence to the forest of zenda
half an hours leisurely walking brought me to the castle it had been
a fortress in old days and the ancient keep was still in good
preservation and very imposing behind it stood another portion of the
original castle and behind that again and separated from it by a deep
and broad moat which ran all round the old buildings was a handsome
modern chateau erected by the last king and now forming the country
residence of the duke of str elsa u the old and the new portions were
connected by a drawbridge and this indirect mode of access formed the
only passage between the old building and the outer world but leading
to the modern chateau there was abroad and handsome avenue it was an
ideal residence when black michael desired company he could dwell in
his chateau if a fit of misanthropy seized him he had merely to cross
the bridge and draw it up after him it ran on rollers and nothing
short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out i went
on my way glad that poor black michael though he could not have the
throne or the princess had atleast as fine a residence as any prince
in europe

soon i entered the forest and walked on for an hour or more in its cool
sombre shade the great trees enlace d with one another over my head and
the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds and
hardly bigger i was enchanted with the place and finding a felled
tree trunk propped my back against it and stretching my legs out gave
myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods
and to the comfort of a good cigar and when the cigar was finished and
i had i suppose inhaled as much beauty as i could i went off into
the most delightful sleep regardless of my train to str elsa u and of
the fast waning afternoon to remember a train in such a spot would
have been rank sacrilege instead of that i fell to dreaming that i
was married to the princess flavia and dwelt in the castle of zenda and
beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest which made
a very pleasant dream in fact i was just impressing a fervent kiss on
the charming lips of the princess when i heard and the voice seemed at
first apart of the dream someone exclaim in rough strident tones

why the devils in its have him and hed be the king

the idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream by the sacrifice of my
heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial i was to be transformed
into a monarch i was about to kiss the princess again when i arrived
very reluctantly at the conclusion that i was awake

i opened my eyes and found t women regarding me with much curiosity
both wore shooting costumes and carried guns one was rather short
and very stoutly built with a big bullet shaped head a bristly grey
moustache and small pale blue eyes at rifle bloodshot the other was a
slender young fellow of middle height dark in complexion and bearing
himself with grace and distinction i set the one down as an old
soldier the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society
but not unused to military life either it turned out afterwards that my
guess was a good one

the elder man approached me beckoning the younger to follow he did so
courteously raising his hat i rose slowly to my feet

hes the height too i heard the elder murmur a she surveyed my six
feet two inches of stature then with a cavalier touch of the cap he
addressed me

may i ask your name

as you have taken the first step in the acquaintance gentlemen said
i with a smile suppose you give me a lead in the matter of names

the youngman stepped forward with a pleasant smile

this said he is colonels apt and i am called fritz vont arlen heim
we are both in the service of the king of ruritan i a

i bowed and baring my head answered

i am rudolf ras send yl liam a traveller from england and once for a
year or two i held a commission from her majesty the queen

then we are all brethren of the sword answered t arlen heim holding
out his hand which i took readily

ras send yll ras send yll muttered colonels apt the nagle am of
intelligence flitted across his face

by heaven he cried you re of the bur les dons

my brother is now lord burle sd on said i

thy head betray eth the e he chuckled pointing to my uncovered poll
why fritz you know the story

the youngman glanced apologetically at me he felt a delicacy which
my sister in law would have admired to put him a this ease i remarked
with a smile

ah the story is known here as well as among us it seems

known cried sapt if you stay here the deuce a man in all ruritan i a
will doubt of it or a woman either

i began to feel uncomfortable had i realized what a very plainly
written pedigree i carried about with me i should have thought long
before i visited ruritan i a however i was in for it now

at this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us

fritz fritz where are you man

t arlen heim started and said hastily

its the king

olds apt chuckled again

then a youngman jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood
beside us as i looked at him i uttered an astonished cry and he
seeing me drew back in sudden wonder saving the hair on my face and
a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him saving also
that he lacked perhaps half an inch nay less than that but still
something of my height the king of ruritan i a might have been rudolf
ras send yll and i rudolf the king

for an instant we stood motionless looking at one another then i bared
my head again and bowed respectfully the king found his voice and
asked in bewilderment

colonel fritz who is this gentleman

i was about to answer when colonels apt stepped between the king and
me and began to talk to his majesty in a low growl the king towered
over sapt and a she listened his eyes now and again sought mine
i looked at him long and carefully the likeness was certainly
astonishing though i saw the points of difference also the kings face
was slightly more fleshy than mine the oval of its contour the least
trifle more pronounced and as i fancied his mouth lacking something
of the firmness or obstinacy which was to be gathered from
my close shutting lips but for all that and above all minor
distinctions the likeness rose striking salient wonderful

sapt ceased speaking and the king still frowned then gradually the
corners of his mouth began to twitch his nose came down as mine
does when i laugh his eyes twinkled and behold he burst into the
merriest fit of irrepressible laughter which rang through the woods and
proclaimed him a jovial soul

well met cousin he cried stepping up to me clapping me on the
back and laughing still you must forgive me if i was taken a back a
man doesnt expect to see double at this timeofday eh fritz

i must pray pardon sire for my presumption said ii trust it will
not forfeit your majestys favour

by heaven youll always enjoy the kings countenance he laughed
whether i like it or not and siri shall very gladly add to it what
services i can where are you travelling to

to str elsa us i re to the coronation

the king looked a this friends he still smiled though his expression
hinted some uneasiness but the humorous side of the matter caught him
again

fritz fritz he cried a thousand crowns for a sight of brother
michaels face when he sees a pair of us and the merry laugh rang out
again

seriously observed fritz vont arlen heim i question mrr as send y lls
wisdom in visiting str elsa u just now

the king lita cigarette

wells apt said he questioningly

he must nt go growled the old fellow

come colonel you mean that i should be in mrr as send y lls debt

o hay wrap it up in the right ways aids apt hauling a great pipe
out of his pocket

no by thunder you shant and thats sans phrase ass apt likes it
for you shall dine with me tonight happen what will afterwards come
man you dont meet a new relation everyday

shrugged his shoulders head de do hill remember our early start
fritz

so will i tomorrow morning said olds apt pulling a this pipe

o wise olds apt cried the king come mrr as send yll by the way
what name did they give you

your majesty si answered bowing

well that shows they werent ashamed of us he laughed come then
cousin rudolf ive got no house of my own here but my dear brother
michael lends usa place of his and well makeshift to entertain you
there and he put his arm through mine and signing to the others to
accompany us walked me off westerly through the forest

we walked for more than half an hour and the king smoked cigarettes
and chattered incessantly he was full of interest in my family laughed
heartily when it old him of the portraits with elph berg hair in our
galleries and yet more heartily when he heard that my expedition to
ruritan i a was a secret one

you have to visit your disreputable cousin on the sly have you said
he

suddenly emerging from the wood we came on a small and rude
hunting lodge it was a one storey building a sort of bungalow built
entirely of wood as we approached it a little man in a plain livery
came out to meet us the only other person i saw about the place was
a fat elderly woman whom i afterwards discovered to be the mother of
johann the dukes keeper

well is dinner ready josef asked the king

the little servant informed us that it was and we soon sat down to a
plentiful meal the fare was plain enough the king ate heartily fritz
vont arlen heim delicately olds apt voraciously i played a good
knife and fork as my custom is the king noticed my performance with
approval

were all good trencher men we elph bergs said he but what were
eating dry wine josef wine man are we beasts to eat without
drinking are we cattle josef

at this reproof josef hastened to load the table with bottles

remember tomorrow said fritz

ay tomorrow said olds apt

the king drained a bumper to his cousin rudolf a she was gracious or
merry enough to call mean did rank its fellow to the elph berg red
where a the laughed loudly

now be the meat what it might the wine we drank was beyond all price
or praise and we did it justice fritz ventured once to stay the kings
hand

what cried the king remember you start before i do master
fritz you must be more sparing by two hours than i

fritz saw that i did not understand

the colonel and i he explained leave here at six we ride down to
zenda and return with the guard of honour to fetch the king at eight
and then we all ride together to the station

hang that same guard growled sapt

oh its very civil of my brother to ask the honour for his regiment
said the king come cousin you need not start early another bottle
man

i had another bottle or rather apart of one for the larger half
travelled quickly down his majestys throat fritz gave up his attempts
at persuasion from persuading he fell to being persuaded and soon we
were all of us as full of wine as we had any right to be the king began
talking of what he would do in the future olds apt of what he had
done in the past fritz of some beautiful girl or other and i of the
wonderful merits of the elph berg dynasty we all talked at once and
followed to the letters apts exhortation to let the morrow take care of
itself

at last the king set down his glass and leant back in his chair

i have drunk enough said he

far be it from me to contradict the king said i

indeed his remark was most absolutely true so far as it went

while i yet spoke josef came and set before the king a marvellous old
wicker covered flag on it had la in so long in some darkened cellar that
it seemed to blink in the candlelight

his highness the duke of st rels aubade me set this wine before the
king when the king was weary of all other wines and pray the king to
drink for the love that he bears his brother

well done black michael said the king out with the cork josef
hang him did he think id flinch from his bottle

the bottle was opened and josef filled the kings glass the king
tasted it then with a solemnity born of the hour and his own
condition he looked round on us

gentlemen my friends rudolf my cousin tisa scandalous story
rudolf on my honour everything is yours to the half of ruritan i a
but ask me not for a single drop of this divine bottle which i will
drink to the health of that that sly knave my brother black michael

and the king seized the bottle and turned it over his mouth and drained
it and flung it from him and laid his head on his arms on the table

and we drank pleasant dreams to his majesty and that is all i remember
of the evening perhaps it is enough





chapter

the king keeps his appointment


whether i had slept a minute or a year i knew not i awoke with a start
and a shiver my face hair and clothes dripped water and opposite me
stood olds apta sneering smile on his face and an empty bucket in his
hand on the table by him sat fritz vont arlen he impale as a ghost and
black as a crow under the eyes

i leapt to my feet in anger

your joke goes too far siri cried

tut man weve no time for quarrelling nothing else would rouse you
its five oclock

ill thankyou colonels apt i began again hot in spirit though i
was uncommonly cold in body

ras send yll interrupted fritz getting down from the table and taking
my arm look here

the king lay full length on the floor his face was red as his hair
and he breathed heavily sapt the disrespectful old dog kicked him
sharply he did not stir nor was there any break in his breathing i
saw that his face and head were wet with water as were mine

weve spent half an hour on him said fritz

he drank three times what either of you did growled sapt

i knelt down and felt his pulse it was alarmingly languid and slow we
three looked at one another

was it drugged that last bottle i asked in a whisper

i dont knows aids apt

we must get a doctor

theres none within ten miles and a thousand doctors wouldnt take
him to st rels auto day i know the look of it hell not move for six or
seven hours yet

but the coronation i cried in horror

fritz shrugged his shoulders as i began to see was his habit on most
occasions

we must send word that he sill he said

i suppose so said i

olds apt who seemed as fresh as a daisy had li this pipe and was
puffing hard at it

if hes not crowned today said he ill lay a crown hes never
crowned

but heavens why

the whole nations there to meet him half the army ay and black
michael at the head shall we send word that the kings drunk

that he sill said i in correction

ill echoed sapt with a scornful laugh they know his illnesses too
well hes been ill before

well we must chance what they think said fritz helplessly ill
carry the news and make the best of it

sapt raised his hand

tell me said he do you think the king was drugged

i do said i

and who drugged him

that damned hound black michael said fritz between his teeth

ay said sapt that he might not come to be crowned ras send yll here
doesnt know our pretty michael what think you fritz has michael no
king ready has half str elsa uno other candidate as gods alive man
the thrones lost if the king show himself not instr els auto day i know
black michael

we could carry him there said i

and a very pretty picture he makes sneered sapt

fritz vont arlen heim buried his face in his hands the king breathed
loudly and heavily sapt stirred him again with his foot

the drunken dog he said but he san elph berg and the son of his
father and may i rot in hell before black michaels its in his place

for a moment or two we were all silent then sapt knitting his bushy
grey brows took his pipe from his mouth and said to me

as a man grows old he believes in fate fate sent you here fate sends
you now to str elsa u

i staggered back murmuring good god

fritz looked up with an eager bewildered gaze

impossible i muttered i should be known

its a risk against a certainty said sapt if you shave ill wager
youll not be known are you afraid

sir

come lad there there but its your life you know if you re
known and mine and fritz s here but if you dont go is wear to you
black michael will sit tonight on the throne and the king lie in prison
or his grave

the king would never forgive it i stammered

are we women who cares for his forgiveness

the clock ticked fifty times and sixty and seventy times as i stood in
thought then i suppose a look came over my face for olds apt caught me
by the hand crying

youll go

yes ill go said i and i turned my eyes on the prostrate figure of
the king on the floor

to nights apt went on in a hasty whisper we are to lodge in the
palace the moment they leave us you and i will mount our horses fritz
must stay there and guard the kings room and ride here at a gallop
the king will be ready josef will tell him and he must ride back with
me to str elsa u and your ideas if the devil were behind you to the
frontier

i took it all in in a second and nodded my head

theresa chance said fritz with his first sign of hopefulness

if i escape detection said i

if were detected said sap till send black michael down below
before i go myself so help me heavens it in that chairman

i obeyed him

he darted from the room calling josef josef in three minutes he was
back and josef with him the latter carried a jug of hot water soap
and razor she was trembling ass apt told him how the land lay and bade
him shave me

suddenly fritz smote on hist high

but the guard theyll know theyll know

pooh we shant wait for the guard well ride to h of bau and catch a
train there when they come the bird ll be flown

but the king

the king will be in the winecellar im going to carry him there now

if they find him

they wont how should they josef will put them off

but

sapt stamped his foot

were not playing he roared my god dont i know the risk if
they do find him hes no worse off than if he isnt crowned today in
str elsa u

so speaking he flung the door open and stooping put forth a strength
i did not dream he had and lifted the king in his hands and a she did
so the old woman johann the keepers mother stood in the doorway
for a moment she stood then she turned on her heel without a sign of
surprise and clattered down the passage

has she heard cried fritz

ill shut her mouths aids apt grimly and he bore off the king in his
arms

for me is at down in an armchair and as is at there half dazed josef
clipped and scraped me till my moustache and imperial were things of the
past and my face was as b areas the kings and when fritz saw me thus
he drew along breath and exclaimed

by jove we shall do it

it was six oclock now and we had no time to loses apt hurried me into
the kings room and i dressed myself in the uniform of a colonel of the
guard finding time as i slipped on the kings boots to asks apt what he
had done with the old woman

she swore shed heard nothing said he but to make sure i tied her
legs together and put a handkerchief in her mouth and bound her hands
and locked her up in the coal cellar nextdoor to the king josef will
look after them both later on

then iburst out laughing and even olds apt grimly smiled

i fancy said he that when josef tells them the king is gone theyll
think it is because we smelt a rat for you may swear black michael
doesnt expect to see hi minstrels auto day

i put the kings helmet on my head olds apt handed me the kings sword
looking at me long and carefully

thank god he shaved his beard he exclaimed

why did he i asked

because princess flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously
pleased to give her a cousin ly kiss come though we must ride

is all safe here

no things safe anywhere said sapt but we can make it no safer

fritz now rejoined us in the uniform of a captain in the same regiment
as that to which my dress belonged in four minutes sapt had arrayed
himself in his uniform josef called that the horses were ready we
jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot the game had begun
what would the issue of it be

the cool morning air cleared my head and i was able to take in all
sapt said to me he was wonderful fritz hardly spoke riding like a man
asleep but sapt without another word for the king began at once to
instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life of my family
of my tastes pursuits weaknesses friends companions and servants
he told me the etiquette of the ruritan ian court promising to be
constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom i ought to know and
give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them

by the way he said your ea catholic i suppose

not ii answered

lord hesa heretic groaned sapt and forthwith he fell to a
rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the romish faith

luckily said he you wont be expected to know much for the kings
notoriously lax and careless about such matters but you must be as
civil as butter to the cardinal we hope to win him over because he and
michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence

we were by now at the station fritz had recovered nerve enough to
explain to the astonished stationmaster that the king had changed his
plans the train steamed up we got into a first class carriage and
sapt leaning back on the cushions went on with his lesson i looked at
my watch the kings watch it was of course it was just eight

i wonder if theyve gone to look for us i said

i hope they wont find the king said fritz nervously and this time
it was sapt who shrugged his shoulders

the train travelled well and at half past nine looking out of the
window i saw the towers and spires of a great city

your capital my liege grinned olds apt with a wave of his hand
and leaning forward he laid his finger on my pulse a little too
quick said he in his grumbling tone

im not made of stone i exclaimed

youll do said he with a nod we must say fritz here has caught the
ague drain your flask fritz for heavens sake boy

fritz did a she was bid

were an hour early said sapt well send word forward for your
majestys arrival for there ll be no one here to meet us yet and
meanwhile

meanwhile said i the king ll be hanged if he doesnt have some
breakfast

olds apt chuckled and held out his hand

your ean elph berg every inch of you said he then he paused and
looking at us said quietly godsend we maybe alive tonight

a men said fritz vont arlen heim

the train stopped fritz and sapt leapt out uncovered and held the
door for me i choked down a lump that rose in my throat settled my
helmet firmly on my head and im not ashamed to say it breathed a
short prayer to god then i stepped on the platform of the station at
str elsa u

a moment later all was bustle and confusion men hurrying up hats
in hand and hurrying off again men conducting me to the buffet men
mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops to the
cathedral to the residence of duke michael even as i swallowed the
last drop of my cup of coffee the bells throughout all the city broke
out into a joyful peal and the sound of a military band and of men
cheering smote upon m year

king rudolf the fifth was in his good city of str elsa u and they shouted
outside

god save the king

olds apts mouth wrinkled into a smile

god save em both he whispered courage lad and if el this hand
press my knee




chapter

the adventures of an under study


with fritz vont arlen heim and colonels apt close behind me i stepped
out of the buffet on to the platform the last thing i did was to feel
if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard a gay
group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting meat their head
at all oldman covered with medals and of military bearing he wore
the yellow and red ribbon of the red rose of ruritan i a which by the
way decorated my unworthy breast also

marshal strake nc z whispered sapt and i knew that i was in the
presence of the most famous veteran of the ruritan ian army

just behind the marshal stood a short spare man in flowing robes of
black and crimson

the chancellor of the kingdom whispered sapt

the marshal greeted me in a few loyal words and proceeded to deliver
an apology from the duke of str elsa u the duke it seemed had been
afflicted with a sudden in disposition which made it impossible for him
to come to the station but he craved leave to await his majesty at the
cathedral i expressed my concern accepted the marshals excuses very
suavely and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished
personages no one betrayed the least suspicion and i felt my nerve
returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding but fritz
was still pale and his hands hook like a leaf a she extended it to the
marshal

presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the
station here i mounted my horse the marshal holding my stirrup the
civil dignitaries went off to their carriages and i started to ride
through the streets with the marshal on my right and sapt who as my
chief aide decamp was entitled to the place on my left the city of
str elsa u is partly old and partly new spacious modern boulevards and
residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow tortuous and
picturesque streets of the original town in the outer circles the upper
classes live in the inner the shops are situated and behind their
prosperous fronts lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys
filled with a poverty stricken turbulent and in large measure
criminal class these social and local divisions corresponded as i knew
from s apts information to another division more important to me the
newtown was for the king but to the oldtown michael of str elsa u was a
hope a hero and a darling

the scene was very brilliant as we passed along the grand boulevard and
on to the great square where the royal palace stood here i was in
the midst of my devoted adherents every house was hung with red and
bedecked with flags and mottoes the streets were lined with raised
seats on each side and i passed along bowing this way and that under
a shower of cheers blessings and waving handkerchiefs the balconies
were full of gaily dressed ladies who clapped their hands and curtsied
and threw their brightest glance sat me a torrent of red roses fell on
me one bloom lodged in my horses mane and i took it and stuck it in
my coat the marshal smiled grimly i had stolen some glances a this
face but he was too impassive to show me whether his sympathies were
with me or not

the red rose for the elph bergs marshal said i gaily and he nodded

i have written gaily and a strange word it must seem but the truth
is that i was drunk with excitement at that moment i believed i
almost believed that i was in very truth the king and with a look of
laughing triumph i raised my eyes to the beauty laden balconies again
and then i started for looking down on me with her handsome
face and proud smile was the lady who had been my fellow
traveller antoinette dem au ban and i saw her also start and her lips
moved and she leant forward and gazed at me and i collecting myself
me there yes full and square while again i felt my revolver suppose
she had cried aloud thats not the king

well we went by and then the marshal turning round in his saddle
waved his hand and the cuirass iers closed round us so that the crowd
could not come near me we were leaving my quarter and entering duke
michaels and this action of the marshals showed me more clearly than
words what the state of feeling in the town must be but if fate made me
a king the least i could do was to play the part handsomely

why this change in our order marshal said i

the marshal bit his white moustache

it is more prudent sire he murmured

i drew re in

let those in front ride on said i till they are fifty yards ahead
but do you marshal and colonels apt and my friends wait here till
i have ridden fifty yards and see that no one is nearer tomei will
have my people see that their king trusts them

sapt laid his hand on my arm is hook him off the marshal hesitated

am i not understood said i and biting his moustache again he gave
the orders is a wolds apt smiling into his beard but he shook his
head at me if i had been killed in open day in the streets of str elsa u
s apts position would have been a difficult one

perhaps i ought to say that i was dressed all in white except my boots
i wore a silver helmet with gilt ornaments and the broad ribbon of the
rose looked well across my chest i should be paying a poor compliment
to the king if i did not set modesty aside and admit that i made a very
fine figure so the people thought for when i riding alone entered
the dingy sparsely decorated sombre streets of the oldtown there
was first a murmur then a cheer and a woman from a window above a
cookshop cried the old local saying

if hes red hes right where at i laughed and took off my helmet that
she might see that i was of the right colour and they cheered me again
at that

it was more interesting riding thus alone for i heard the comments of
the crowd

he looks paler than his wont said one

you d look pale if you lived a she does was the highly disrespectful
retort

hesa big german than i thought said another

so he had a good jaw under that beard after all commented a third

the pictures of him arent handsome enough declared a pretty girl
taking great care that i should hear no doubt it was mere flattery

but inspite of these signs of approval and interest the mass of
the people received me in silence and with sullen looks and my dear
brothers portrait ornamented most of the windows which was an ironical
sort of greeting to the king i was quite glad that he had been spared
the unpleasant sigh the was a man of quick temper and perhaps he would
not have taken it so placidly as i did

at last we were at the cathedral its great grey front embellished
with hundreds of statues and boasting a pair of the finest oak doors in
europe rose for the first time before me and the sudden sense of my
audacity almost overcame me everything was in a mist as i dismounted i
saw the marshal and sapt dimly and dimly the throng of gorgeously robed
priests who awaited me and my eyes were still dimasi walked up the
great nave with the pealing of the organ in m years i saw nothing of
the brilliant throng that filled it i hardly distinguished the stately
figure of the cardinal a she rose from the archi episcopal throne to
greet me two faces only stood outside by side clearly before my
eyes the face of a girl pale and lovely surmounted by a crown of the
glorious elph berg hair for in a woman it is glorious and the face
of a man whose full blooded red cheeks black hair and dark deep eyes
told me that at last i was in presence of my brother black michael and
when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment and his helmet
fell with a clatter on the floor till that moment i believe that he had
not realized that the king was in very truth come to str elsa u

of what followed next i remember nothing i knelt before the altar and
the cardinal anointed my head then i rose to my feet and stretched out
my hand and took from him the crown of ruritan i a and set it on my head
and is wore the old oath of the king and if it were as in may it be
for given me i received the holy sacrament there before them all then
the great organ pealed out again the marshal bade the heralds proclaim
me and rudolf the fifth was crowned king of which imposing ceremony an
excellent picture hangs now in my diningroom the portrait of the king
is very good

then the lady with the paleface and the glorious hair her train held
by two pages stepped from her place and came to where i stood and a
herald cried

her royal highness the princess flavia

she curtsied low and put her hand undermine and raised my hand and
kissed it and for an instant i thought what i had best do then i
drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek and she blushed red
and then his eminence the cardinal archbishop slipped in front of black
michael and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the
pope the first and last which i have received from that exalted
quarter

and then came the duke of str elsa u his step trembled is wear and
he looked to the right and to the left as a man looks who thinks on
flight and his face was patched with red and white and his hands hook
so that it jumped undermine and if el this lips dry and parched and
i glanced at sapt who was smiling again into his beard and resolutely
doing my duty in that station of life to which i had been marvellously
called i took my dear michael by both hands and kissed him on the
cheek i think we were both glad when that was over

but neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did i
see the least doubt or questioning yet had i and the king stood side
by side she could have told us in an instant or atleast on a little
consideration but neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that
i could be other than the king so the likeness served and for an hour
i stood there feeling as weary and blase as though i had been a king
all my life and everybody kissed my hand and the ambassadors paid me
their respects among the mold lord topham at whose house in grosvenor
square i had danced a score of times thank heaven the oldman was as
blind as a bat and did not claim my acquaintance

then back we went through the streets to the palace and i heard them
cheering black michael but he fritz told me sat biting his nails like
a man in a reverie and even his own friends said that he should have
made a braver show i was in a carriage now side by side with the
princess flavia and a rough fellow cried out

and when s the wedding and a she spoke another struck him in the
face crying long live duke michael and the princess coloured it was
an admirable tint and looked straight in front of her

now i felt in a difficulty because i had forgotten to asks apt the
state of my affections or how far matters had gone between the princess
and myself frankly had i been the king the further they had gone the
better should i have been pleased for i am not as low blooded man and
i had not kissed princess flavia s cheek for nothing these thoughts
passed through my head but not being sure of my ground i said
nothing and in a moment or two the princess recovering her equanimity
turned to me

do you know rudolf said she you look somehow different today

the fact was not surprising but the remark was disquieting

you look she went on more sober more sedate you real most
careworn and i declare you re thinner surely its not possible that
youve begun to take anything seriously

the princess seemed to hold of the king much the same opinion that lady
burle sd on held of me

i braced myself up to the conversation

would that please you i asked softly

oh you know my views said she turning here yes away

whatever pleases you i try to do i said and as i saw her smile and
blush i thought that i was playing the kings hand very well for him
so i continued and what i said was perfectly true

i assure you my dear cousin that nothing in my life has affected me
more than the reception ive been greeted with today

she smiled brightly but in an instant grew grave again and whispered

did you notice michael

yes said i adding he wasnt enjoying himself

do be careful she went on you dont indeed you dont keep enough
watch on him you know

i know said i that he wants what ive got

yes hush

then and icant justify it for i committed the king far beyond what i
had a right to do i suppose she carried me off my feet i went on

and perhaps also something which i havent got yet but hope to win
someday

this was my answer had i been the king i should have thought it
encouraging

havent you enough responsibilities on you for one day cousin

bangbang blare blare we were at the palace guns were firing
and trumpets blowing rows of lackeys stood waiting and handing the
princess up the broad marble staircase i took formal possession as
a crowned king of the house of my ancestors and sat down at my own
table with my cousin on my righthand on her other side black michael
and on my left his eminence the cardinal behind my chair stood sapt
and at the end of the table i saw fritz vont arlen heim drain to the
bottom his glass of champagne rather sooner than he decently should

i wondered what the king of ruritan i a was doing




chapter

the secret of a cellar


we were in the kings dressing room fritz vont arlen he ims apt and i
if lung myself exhausted into an armchairs apt li this pipe he uttered
no congratulations on the marvellous success of our wild risk but his
whole bearing was eloquent of satisfaction the triumph aided perhaps
by good wine had made a newman of fritz

what a day for you to remember he cried ga did like to be king
for twelve hours myself but ras send yll you must nt throw your heart
too much into the part i dont wonder black michael looked blacker than
ever you and the princess had so much to say to one another

how beautiful she is i exclaimed

nevermind the woman growled sapt are you ready to start

yes said i with a sigh

it was five oclock and at twelve i should be no more than rudolf
ras send yll i remarked on it in a joking tone

youll be lucky observed sapt grimly if you re not the late rudolf
ras send yll by heaven i feel my head wobbling on my shoulders every
minute you re in the city do you know friend that michael has had
news from zenda he went into a room alone to read it and he came out
looking like amanda zed

im ready said i this news making men one the more eager to linger

s apts at down

i must write us an order to leave the city michaels governor you
know and we must be prepared for hindrances you must sign the order

my dear colonel ive not been breda forger

out of his pockets apt produced a piece of paper

theres the kings signature he said and here he went on after
another search in his pocket is some tracing paper if you cant
manage a rudolf in ten minutes why i can

your education has been more comprehensive than mine said i you
write it

and a very tolerable forgery did this versatile hero produce

now fritz said he the king goes to bed he is upset no one is to
see him till nine oclock tomorrow you understand no one

i understand answered fritz

michael may come and claim immediate audience youll answer that only
princes of the blood are entitled to it

that ll annoy michael laughed fritz

you quite understand asked sapt again if the door of this room is
opened while were away you re not to be alive to tell us about it

i need no schooling colonel said fritz at rifle haughtily

here wrap yourself in this big cloaks apt continued to me and
put on this flat cap my orderly rides with me to the hunting lodge
tonight

there san obstacle i observed the horse doesnt live that can
carry me forty miles

oh yes he does two of him one here one at the lodge now are you
ready

im ready said i

fritz held out his hand

in case said he and we shook hands heartily

damn your sentiment growled sapt come along

he went not to the door but to a panel in the wall

in the old kings time said he i knew this way well

i followed him and we walked as i should estimate near two hundred
yards along a narrow passage then we came toast out oak doors apt
unlocked it we passed through and found ourselves in a quiet street
that ran along the back of the palace gardens a man was waiting for us
with two horses one was a magnificent bay up to any weight the other
a sturdy browns apt signed to me to mount the bay without a word
to the man we mounted and rode away the town was full of noise and
merriment but we took secluded ways my cloak was wrapped over half
my face the capacious flat cap hide very lock of my telltale hair by
s apts directions i crouched on my saddle and rode with such around
back as i hope never to exhibit on a horse again down along narrow
lane we went meeting some wanderers and some roi ster ers and as we
rode we heard the cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to
the king it was half past six and still light at last we came to the
city wall and to agate

have your weapon ready whispered sapt we must stop his mouth if he
talks

i put my hand on my revolvers apt hailed the doorkeeper the stars
fought for usa little girl of fourteen tripped out

please sir fathers gone to see the king

hed better have stayed here said sapt to me grinning

but he said i wasnt to open the gate sir

did he my dear said sapt dismounting then give me the key

the key was in the childs hands apt gave her a crown

here san order from the king show it to your father orderly open
the gate

i leapt down between us we rolled back the great gate led our horses
out and closed it again

i shall be sorry for the doorkeeper if michael finds out that he wasnt
there now then lad for a canter we must nt go too fast while were
near the town

once however outside the city we ran little danger for everybody
else was inside merrymaking and as the evening fell we quickened our
pace my splendid horse bounding along under me as though i had been a
feather it was a fine night and presently the moon appeared we talked
little on the way and chiefly about the progress we were making

i wonder what the dukes despatches told him said i once

ayi wonder responded sapt

we stopped for a draught of wine and to bait our horses losing half an
hour thus i dared not go into the inn and stayed with the horses
in the stable then we went ahead again and had covered some
five and twenty miles when sapt abruptly stopped

hark he cried

i listened away far behind us in the still of the evening it was
just half past nine we heard the beat of horses hoofs the wind
blowing strong behind us carried the sound i glanced at sapt

come on he cried and spurred his horse into a gallop when we next
paused to listen the hoofbeats were not audible and we relaxed our
pace then we heard them again sapt jumped down and laid his ear to the
ground

there are two he said they re only a mile behind thank god the
road curves in and out and the winds our way

we galloped on we seemed to beholding our own we had entered the
outskirts of the forest of zenda and the trees closing in behind us as
the track zig ged and zagg ed prevented us seeing our pursuers and them
from seeing us

another half hour brought us to a divide of the roads apt drew re in

to the right is our road he said to the left to the castle each
about eight miles get down

but theyll be on us i cried

get down he repeated brusquely and i obeyed the wood was dense up
to the very edge of the road we led our horses into the covert bound
handkerchiefs over their eyes and stood beside them

you want to see who they are i whispered

ay and where they re going he answered

i saw that his revolver was in his hand

nearer and nearer came the hoofs the moon shone out now clear and full
so that the road was white with it the ground was hard and we had left
not races

here they come whispered sapt

its the duke

i thought so he answered

it was the duke and with him a burly fellow whom i knew well and who
had cause to know me afterwards max hol f brother to johann the keeper
and body servant to his highness they were up to us the duke reined
up i saws apts finger curl lovingly towards the trigger i believe
he would have given ten years of his life for a shot and he could have
picked off black michael as easily as i could a barndoor fowl in a
farmyard i laid my hand on his arm he nodded reassuringly he was
always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty

which way asked black michael

to the castle your highness urged his companion there we shall
learn the truth

for an instant the duke hesitated

i thought i heard hoofs said he

i think not your highness

why shouldnt we goto the lodge

i fear a trap if all is well why goto the lodge if not its a
snare to trap us

suddenly the dukes horse neigh ed in an instant we folded our cloaks
close round our horses heads and holding them thus covered the duke
and his attendant with our revolvers if they had found us they had
been dead men or our prisoners

michael waited a moment longer then he cried

to zenda then and setting spurs to his horse galloped on

sapt raised his weapon after him and there was such an expression
of wistful regret on his face that i had much a do not to burst out
laughing

for ten minutes we stayed where we were

you see said sapt theyve sent him news that all is well

what does that mean i asked

god knows said sapt frowning heavily but its brought him from
str elsa u in a rare puzzle

then we mounted and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their
feet to the ground for those last eight miles we spoke no more our
minds were full of apprehension all is well what did it mean was
all well with the king

at last the lodge came insight spurring our horses to a last gallop
we rode up to the gate all was still and quiet not a soul came to meet
us we dismounted in haste suddenly sapt caught me by the arm

look there he said pointing to the ground

i looked down at my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs torn and
slashed and rent i turned to him questioningly

they re what i tied the old woman up with said he fasten the
horses and come along

the handle of the door turned without resistance we passed into the
room which had been the scene of last nights bout it was still strewn
with the remnants of our meal and with empty bottles

come on cried sapt whose marvellous composure had at last almost
given way

we rushed down the passage towards the cellars the door of the
coal cellar stood wide open

they found the old woman said i

you might have known that from the handkerchiefs he said

then we came opposite the door of the winecellar it was shut it
looked in all respects as it had looked when we left it that morning

come its all right said i

aloud oath from sap trang out his face turned pale and he pointed
again at the floor from under the door a red stain had spread over the
floor of the passage and dried theresa pt sank against the opposite
wall i tried the door it was locked

where s josef muttered sapt

where s the king i responded

sapt took out a flask and put it to his lips iran back to the
diningroom and seized a heavy poker from the fireplace in my terror
and excitement i rained blows on the lock of the door and i fired a
cartridge into it it gave way and the door swung open

give me a light said i but sapt still leant against the wall

he was of course more moved than i for he loved his master afraid
for himself he was not no man ever saw him that but to think what
might lie in that dark cellar was enough to turn any mans face pale
i went myself and took a silver candlestick from the dining table and
struck a light and as i returned i felt the hot wax drip on my naked
hand as the candle swayed to and fro so that i can not afford to despise
colonels apt for his agitation

i came to the door of the cellar the red stain turning more and more to
a dull brown stretched inside i walked two yards into the cellar and
held the candle high above my head i saw the full bins of wine i saw
spiders crawling on the walls i saw too a couple of empty bottles
lying on the floor and then away in the corner i saw the body of a
man lying flat on his back with his arms stretched wide and a crimson
gash across his throat i walked to him and knelt down beside him and
commended to god the soul of a faithful man for it was the body of
josef the little servants la in in guarding the king

i felt a hand on my shoulders and turning saws apt eyes glaring and
terror struck beside me

the king my god the king he whispered hoarsely

i threw the candles gleam over every inch of the cellar

the king is not here said i




chapter

his majesty sleeps instr elsa u


i put my arm rounds apts waist and supported him out of the cellar
drawing the battered door close after me for ten minutes or more we sat
silent in the diningroom then olds apt rubbed his knuckles into his
eyes gave one great gasp and was himself again as the clock on the
mantelpiece struck one he stamped his foot on the floor saying

theyve got the king

yes said i all swell as black michaels despatch said what
a moment it must have been for him when the royal salutes fired at
str elsa u this morning i wonder when he got the message

it must have been sent in the morning said sapt they must have sent
it before news of your arrival at str elsa u reached zenda i suppose it
came from zenda

and hes carried it about all day i exclaimed upon my honour im
not the only man who shada trying day what did he thinks apt

what does that matter what does he think lad now

i rose to my feet

we must get back i said and rouse every soldier instr elsa uwe
ought to be in pursuit of michael before midday

olds apt pulled out his pipe and carefully lit it from the candle which
g uttered on the table

the king maybe murdered while we si there i urged

sapt smoked on for a moment in silence

that cursed old woman he broke out she must have attracted their
attention somehow i see the game they came up to kidnap the king
and as i say somehow they found him if you hadnt gone to str elsa u
you and i and fritz had been in heaven by now

and the king

who knows where the king is now he asked

come lets be off said i but he sat still and suddenly he burst
into one of his grating chuckles

by jove weve shaken up black michael

come come i repeated impatiently

and well shake him up abit more he added a cunning smile
broadening on his wrinkled weather beaten face and his teeth working
on an end of his grizzled moustache ayla dwell go back to
str elsa u the king shall be in his capital again tomorrow

the king

the crowned king

your emad i cried

if we go back and tell the trick we played what would you give for our
lives

just what they re worth said i

and for the kings throne do you think that the nobles and the people
will enjoy being fooled as youve fooled them do you think theyll love
a king who was too drunk to be crowned and sent a servant to person ate
him

he was drugged and im no servant

mine will be black michaels version

he rose came to me and laid his hand on my shoulder

lad he said if you play the man you may save the king yet go back
and keep his throne warm for him

but the duke knows the villains he has employed know

ay but they cant speak roared sapt in grim triumph

weve got em how can they denounce you without denouncing themselves
this is not the king because we kidnapped the king and murdered his
servant can they say that

the position flashed on me whether michael knew me or no the could not
speak unless he produced the king what could he do and if he produced
the king where was he for a moment i was carried away headlong but in
an instant the difficulties came strong upon me

i must be found out i urged

perhaps but every hours something above all we must have a king in
str elsa u or the city will be michaels in four and twenty hours and
what would the kings life be worth then or his throne lad you must
do it

suppose they kill the king

theyll kill him if you dont

sapt suppose they have killed the king

then by heaven you re as good an elph berg as black michael and you
shall reign in ruritan i a but i dont believe they have nor will they
kill him if you re on the throne will they kill him to put you in

it was a wild plan wilder even and more hopeless than the trick we
had already carried through but as i listened to sapt i saw the strong
points in our game and then i was a youngman and i loved action and i
was offered such a hand in such a game as perhaps never man played yet

i shall be found out i said

perhaps said sapt come to str elsa uwe shall be caught like rats
in a trap if we stay here

sapt i cried ill try it

well played said he i hope theyve left us the horses ill go and
see

we must bury that poor fellow said i

no times aids apt

ill do it

hang you he grinned i make you a king and well do it go and
fetch him while i look to the horse she cantlie very deep but i
doubt if hell care about that poor little josef he was an honest bit
of a man

he went out and i went to the cellar i raised poor josef in my arms
and bore him into the passage and thence towards the door of the house
just inside i laid him down remembering that i must find spades for our
task at this instant sapt came up

the horses are all right theres the own brother to the one that
brought you here but you may save yourself that job

ill not go before hes buried

yes you will

not i colonels apt not for all ruritan i a

you fool said he come here

he drew me to the door the moon was sinking but about three hundred
yards away coming along the road from zenda i made out a party of men
there were seven or eight of them four were on horseback and the rest
were walking and i saw that they carried long implements which i
guessed to be spades and mattocks on their shoulders

theyll save you the troubles aids apt come along

he was right the approaching party must beyond doubt be duke
michaels men come to remove the traces of their evil work i hesitated
no longer but an irresistible desire seized me

pointing to the corpse of poor little josef i said to sapt

colonel we ought to strike a blow for him

you d like to give him some company eh but its too risky work your
majesty

i must have a slap at em said i

sapt wavered

well said he its not business you know but youve been good
boy and if we come to grief why hang me itll save us lot of
thinking ill show you how to touch them

he cautiously closed the open chink of the door

then were treated through the house and made our way to the back
entrance here our horses were standing a carriage drive swept all
round the lodge

revolver ready asked sapt

no steel for me said i

gad you re thirsty tonight chuckled sapt so be it

we mounted drawing our swords and waited silently for a minute or two
then we heard the tramp of men on the drive the other side of the house
they came toast and and one cried

now then fetch him out

now whispered sapt

driving the spurs into our horses we rushed at a gallop round the
house and in a moment we were among the ruffians sapt told me
afterwards that he killed a man and i believe him but i saw no more of
him with a cut i split the head of a fellow on a brown horse and he
fell to the ground then i found myself opposite a big man and i was
half conscious of another to my right it was too warm to stay and with
a simultaneous action i drove my spurs into my horse again and my sword
full into the big mans breast his bullet whizzed past m year i could
almost swear it touched it i wrenched at the sword but it would not
come and i dropped it and galloped after sapt who minow saw about
twenty yards ahead i waved my hand in farewell and dropped it a second
later with a yell for a bullet had grazed my finger and i felt the
blood olds apt turned round in the saddle someone fired again but
they had no rifles and we were out of ranges apt fell to laughing

thats one to me and two to you with decent luck said he little
josef will have company

ay theyll be a partie carree said i my blood was up and i
rejoiced to have killed them

well a pleasant nights work to the rest said he i wonder if they
noticed you

the big fellow did as i stuck him i heard him cry the king

good good oh well give black michael some work before weve done

pausing an instant we made a bandage for my wounded finger which was
bleeding freely and ached severely the bone being much bruised then we
rode on asking of our good horses all that was in them the excitement
of the fight and of our great resolve died away and we rode in gloomy
silence day broke clear and cold we found a farmer just up and made
him give us sustenance for ourselves and our horses i feigning a
toothache muffled my face closely then ahead again till str elsa ulay
before us it was eight oclock or nearing nine and the gates were all
open as they always were save when the dukes caprice or intrigues shut
them we rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before
all four of us the men and the horses wearied and jaded the streets
were even quieter than when we had gone everyone was sleeping off last
nights revelry and we met hardly a soul till we reached the little
gate of the palace theresa pts old groom was waiting for us

is all well sir he asked

all swells aids apt and the man coming to me took my hand to
kiss

the kings hur the cried

its nothing said iasi dismounted i caught my finger in the
door

remember silence said sa ptah but my good frey leri do not need
to tell you that

the old fellow shrugged his shoulders

all young men like to ride abroad now and again why not the king
said he and s apts laugh left his opinion of my motives undisturbed

you should always trust a man observed sapt fitting the key in the
lock just as far as you must

we went in and reached the dressing room flinging open the door we saw
fritz vont arlen heim stretched fully dressed on the sofa he seemed to
have been sleeping but our entry woke him he leapt to his feet gave
one glance at me and with a joyful cry threw himself on his knees
before me

thank god sire thank god you re safe he cried stretching his hand
up to catch hold of mine

i confess that i was moved this king whatever his faults made people
love him for a moment i could not bear to speak or break the poor
fellows illusion but tough olds apt had no such feeling he slapped
his hand on hist high delightedly

bravo lad cried he we shall do

fritz looked up in bewilderment i held out my hand

me up and down and down and up then suddenly he dropped my hand and
reeled back

a knock sounded on the doors apt seized me by the hand

introduced an extremely smart and deferential young gentleman who came
up to my bedside bowing again and again and informed me that he was
of the household of the princess flavia and that her royal highness
had sent him especially to enquire how the kings health was after the
fatigues which his majesty had undergone yesterday

highness that i was never better in my life

recalled us to reality though in faith the farce had to be reality
for us now

is the king dead he whispered

please god no said i but he sin the hands of black michael




chapter

a fair cousin and a dark brother


a real kings life is perhaps a hard one but a pretended kings is
i warrant much harder on the next days apt instructed me in my
duties what i ought to do and what i ought to know for three hours
then i snatched breakfast with sapt still opposite me telling me that
the king always took white wine in the morning and was known to detest
all highly seasoned dishes then came the chancellor for another three
hours and to him i had to explain that the hurt to my finger we turned
that bullet to happy account prevented me from writing whence arose
great to do hunting of precedents and so forth ending in my making
my mark and the chancellor at testing it with a superfluity of solemn
oaths then the french ambassador was introduced to present his
credentials here my ignorance was of no importance as the king would
have been equally raw to the business we worked through the whole corps
diplomatique in the next few days a demise of the crown necessitating
all this bother

then at last i was left alone i called my new servant we had chosen
to succeed poor josefa youngman who had never known the king had a
brandy and soda brought to me and observed to sapt that i trusted that
i might now have a rest fritz vont arlen heim was standing by

by heaven he cried we waste time arent we going to throw black
michael by the heels

gently myson gently said sapt knitting his brows it would be
a pleasure but it might cost us dear would michael fall and leave the
king alive

and i suggested while the king is here instr elsa u on his throne
what grievance has he against his dear brother michael

are we to do nothing then

were to do nothing stupid growled sapt

in fact fritz said ii am reminded of a situation in one of our
english plays the critic have you heard of it or if you like of two
men each covering the other with a revolver for icant expose michael
without exposing myself

and the king putin sapt

and hang me if michael wont expose himself if he tries to expose
me

its very pretty said olds apt

if im found out i pursued i will make a clean breast of it and
fight it out with the duke but at present im waiting for a move from
him

hell kill the king said fritz

no the said sapt

half of the six are instr elsa usaid fritz

only half you re sure asked sapt eagerly

yes only half

then the kings alive for the other three are guarding him cried
sapt

yes you re right exclaimed fritz his face brightening if the
king were dead and buried they d all be here with michael you know
michaels back colonel

i know curse him

gentlemen gentlemen said i who are the six

i think youll make their acquaintance soon said sapt they are six
gentlemen whom michael maintains in his household they belong to him
body and soul there are three ruritan ians then theresa frenchman a
belgian and one of your countrymen

they d all cut a throat if michael told them said fritz

perhaps theyll cut mine i suggested

nothing more likely agreed sapt who are here fritz

de gaute t berson in and d etc hard

the foreigners its as plain as a pike staff hes brought them and
left the ruritan ians with the king thats because he wants to commit
the ruritan ians as deep a she can

they were none of them among our friends at the lodge then i asked

i wish they had been said sap twist fully they had been not six
but four by now

i had already developed one attribute of royalty a feeling that i need
not reveal all my mind or my secret design seven to my intimate friends
i had fully resolved on my course of action i meant to make myself
as popular as i could and at the same time to show no disfavour to
michael by these means i hoped to allay the hostility of his adherents
and make it appear if an open conflict came about that he was
ungrateful and not oppressed

yet an open conflict was not what i hoped for

the kings interest demanded secrecy and while secrecy lasted i had
a fine game to play instr elsa u michael should not grow stronger for
delay

i ordered my horse and attended by fritz vont arlen heim rode in the
grand new avenue of the royal park returning all the salutes which i
received with punctilious politeness the niro de through a few of the
streets stopped and bought flowers of a pretty girl paying her with
a piece of gold and then having attracted the desired amount of
attention for i had a trail of half a thousand people after me i rode
to the residence of the princess flavia and asked if she would
receive me this step created much interest and was met with shouts of
approval the princess was very popular and the chancellor himself had
not scruple d to hint to me that the more i pressed my suit and the more
rapidly i brought it to a prosperous conclusion the stronger should i
be in the affection of my subjects the chancellor of course did not
understand the difficulties which lay in the way of following his loyal
and excellent advice however i thought i could do no harm by calling
and in this view fritz supported me with a cordiality that surprised me
until he confessed that he also had his motives for liking a visit to
the princess s house which motive was no other than a great desire to
see the princess s lady in waiting and bosom friend the countess helga
von str of z in

etiquette seconded fritz shop es while i was ushered into the
princess s room he remained with the countess in the antechamber in
spite of the people and servants who were hanging about i doubt not
that they manage date tea tete but i had no leisure to think of them
for i was playing the most delicate move in all my difficult game i had
to keep the princess devoted to me and yet in different tomei had to
show affection for her and not feel it i had to make love for another
and that to a girl who princess or no princess was the most beautiful
i had ever seen well i braced myself to the task made no easier by
the charming embarrassment with which i was received how i succeeded in
carrying out my programme will appear hereafter

you are gaining golden laurels she said you are like the prince in
shakespeare who was transformed by becoming king but im forgetting you
are king sire

i ask you to speak nothing but what your heart tells you and to call
me nothing but my name

she looked at me for a moment

then im glad and proud rudolf said she why as it old you your
very face is changed

i acknowledged the compliment but i disliked the topic so i said

my brother is back i hear he made an excursion didn the

yes he is here she said frowning a little

he cant stay long from str elsa u it seems i observed smiling
well we are all glad to see him the nearer he is the better

the princess glanced at me with a gleam of amusement in here yes

why cousin is it that you can

see better what hes doing perhaps said i and why are you glad

i didnt say i was glad she answered

some people says of or you

there are many insolent people she said with delightful haughtiness

possibly you mean that i am one

your majesty could not be she said curtsey ing in feigned deference
but adding mischievously after a pause unless that is

well unless what

unless you tell me that i mind a snap of my fingers where the duke of
str elsa u is

really i wished that i had been the king

you dont care where cousin michael

ah cousin michael i call him the duke of str elsa u

you call him michael when you meet him

yes by the orders of your father

i see and now by mine

if those are your orders

oh decidedly we must all be pleasant to our dear michael

you order me to receive his friends too i suppose

the six

you call them that too

to be in the fashion i do but i order you to receive no one unless
you like

except yourself

i pray for myself i could not order

as i spoke there came a cheer from the street the princess ran to the
window

it is he she cried it is the duke of str elsa u

i smiled but said nothing she returned to her seat for a few moments
we satin silence the noise outside subsided but i heard the tread of
feet in the anteroom i began to talk on general subjects this went on
for some minutes i wondered what had become of michael but it did
not seem to be for me to interfere all at once to my great surprise
flavia clasping her hands asked in an agitated voice

are you wise to make him angry

what who how am i making him angry

why by keeping him waiting

my dear cousin i dont want to keep him

well then is he to come in

of course if you wish it

she looked at me curiously

how funny you are she said of course no one could be announced
while i was with you

here was a charming attribute of royalty

an excellent etiquette i cried but i had clean forgotten it and if
i were alone with someone else couldnt you be announced

you know as well as i do i could be because i am of the blood and
she still looked puzzled

in ever could remember all these silly rules said i rather feebly
as i inwardly cursed fritz for not posting me up but ill repair my
fault

i jumped up flung open the door and advanced into the anteroom
michael was sitting at a table a heavy frown on his face everyone
else was standing save that impudent young dog fritz who was lounging
easily in an armchair and flirting with the countess helga he leapt up
as i entered with a deferential alacrity that lent point to his former
nonchalance i had no difficulty in understanding that the duke might
not like young fritz

i held out my hand michael took it and i embraced him then i drew him
with me into the inner room

brother i said if i had known you were here you should not have
waited a moment before i asked the princess to permit me to bring you to
her

he thanked me but coldly the man had many qualities but he could not
hide his feeling same re stranger could have seen that he hated me and
hated worse to see me with princess flavia yeti am persuaded that he
tried to conceal both feelings and further that he tried to persuade
me that he believed i was verily the king i did not know of course
but unless the king were an impostor at once cleverer and more
audacious than i and i began to think something of myself in that
role michael could not believe that and if he didnt how he must
have loathed paying me deference and hearing my michael and my
flavia

your hand is hurt sire he observed with concern

yes i was playing a game with a mongrel dog i meant to stir him
and you know brother such have uncertain tempers

he smiled sourly and his dark eyes rested on me for a moment

but is there no danger from the bite cried flavia anxiously

none from this said i if i gave him a chance to bite deeper it
would be different cousin

but surely he has been destroyed said she

not yet were waiting to see if his bite is harmful

and if it is asked michael with his sour smile

hell be knocked on the head brother said i

you wont play with him anymore urged flavia

perhaps i shall

he might bite again

doubtless hell try said i smiling

then fearing michael would say something which i must appear to
resent for though i might show him my hate i must seem to be full of
favour i began to compliment him on the magnificent condition of his
regiment and of their loyal greeting to me on the day of my coronation
thence i passed to a rapturous description of the hunting lodge which
he had lent me but he rose suddenly to his fee this temper was failing
him and with an excuse he said farewell however a she reached the
door he stopped saying

three friends of mine are very anxious to have the honour of being
presented to you sire they are herein the antechamber

i joined him directly passing my arm through his the look on his
face was honey to me we entered the antechamber in fraternal fashion
michael beckoned and three men came forward

these gentlemen said michael with a stately courtesy which to
do him justice he could assume with perfect grace and ease are the
loyal est and most devoted of your majestys servants and are my very
faithful and attached friends

on the last ground as much as the first said ii am very pleased to
see them

they came one by one and kissed my hand de gaute tat all lean fellow
with hair standing straight up and waxed moustache berson in the
belgian a port lyman of middle height with a baldhead though he was
not far past thirty and last the english m and etc hard a narrow faced
fellow with close cut fair hair and a bronzed complexion he was a
finely made man broad in the shoulder and slender in the hips a good
fighter but a crooked customer i put him down for i spoke to him in
english with as light foreign accent and is wear the fellow smiled
though he hid the smile in an instant

so mrd etc hard is in the secret thought i

having got rid of my dear brother and his friends i returned to make my
adieu to my cousins he was standing at the door i bade her farewell
taking her hand in mine

rudolf she said very low be careful wont you

of what

you know icant say but think what your life is to

well to

to ruritan i a

was i right to play the part or wrong to play the part i know not
evil lay both ways and i dared not tell her the truth

only to ruritan iai asked softly

a sudden flush spread over her incomparable face

to your friends too she said

friends

and to your cousins he whispered and loving servant

i could not speak i kissed her hand and went out cursing myself

outside i found master fritz quite reckless of the footmen playing at
cats cradle with the countess helga

hang it said he we cant always be plotting love claims his
share

im inclined to think he does said i and fritz who had been by my
side dropped respectfully behind




chapter

a new use for a tea table


if i were to detail the ordinary events of my daily life at this time
they might prove instructive to people who are not familiar with the
inside of palaces if i revealed some of the secrets i learnt they
might prove of interest to the statesmen of europe i intend to do
neither of these things i should be between the scylla of dullness and
the charybdis of in discretion and i feel that i had far better confine
myself strictly to the underground drama which was being played beneath
the surface of ruritan ian politics i need only say that the secret of
my imposture defied detection i made mistakes i had bad minutes it
needed all the tact and graciousness where of i was master to smooth over
some apparent lapses of memory and un mindfulness of old acquaintances of
which i was guilty but i escaped and i attribute my escape as i have
said before most of all to the very audacity of the enterprise it is
my belief that given the necessary physical likeness it was far easier
to pretend to be king of ruritan i a than it would have been to person ate
my nextdoor neighbour one days apt came into my room he threw me a
letter saying

thats for you a woman shandi think but ive some news for you
first

whats that

the kings at the castle of zenda said he

how do you know

because the other half of michaels six are there i had enquiries
made and they re all there lau engram k raf stein and young rupert
hentz au three rogues too on my honour as fine as live in ruritan i a

well

well fritz wants you to march to the castle with horse foot and
artillery

and drag the moat i asked

that would be about it grinned sapt and we shouldnt find the
kings body then

you think its certain hes there

very probable besides the fact of those three being there the
drawbridge is kept up and no one goes in without an order from young
hentz au or black michael himself we must tie fritz up

ill goto zenda said i

your emad

someday

oh perhaps youll very likely stay there though if you do

that maybe my friend said i carelessly

his majesty looks sulky observed sapt how s the love affair

damn you hold your tongue i said

he looked at me for a moment then heli this pipe it was quite true
that i was in a bad temper and i went on perversely

wherever i go im dogged by half a dozen fellows

i know you are is end em he replied composedly

what for

well said sapt puffing away it wouldnt be exactly inconvenient
for black michael if you disappeared with you gone the old game that
we stopped would be played or hed have a shot at it

i can take care of myself

de gaute t berson in and d etc hard are instr elsa u and anyone of
them lad would cut your throat as readily as readily as i would black
michaels and a deal more treacherously whats the letter

i opened it and read it aloud

if the king desires to know what it deeply concerns the king to know
let him do as this letter bids him at the end of the new avenue there
stands a house in large grounds the house has a portico with a statue
of any mph on it a wall encloses the garden there is agate in the
wall at the back at twelve oclock tonight if the king enters alone
by that gate turns to the right and walks twenty yards he will find
a summerhouse approached by a flight of six steps if he mounts and
enter she will find someone who will tell him what touches most dearly
his life and his throne this is written by a faithful friend he must
be alone if he neglects the invitation his life will be in danger let
him show this to no one or he will ruin a woman who loves him black
michael does not pardon

no observed sapt as i ended but he can dictate a very pretty
letter

i had arrived at the same conclusion and was about to throw the letter
away when i saw there was more writing on the other side

hall other es some more

if you hesitate the writer continued consult colonels apt

eh exclaimed that gentleman genuinely astonished does she take me
for a greater fool than you

i waved to him to be silent

ask him what woman would do most to prevent the duke from marrying his
cousin and therefore most to prevent him becoming king and ask if her
name begins with a

i sprang to my feet sapt laid down his pipe

antoinette dem au ban by heaven i cried

how do you know asked sapt

it old him what i knew of the lady and how i knew i the nodded

its so far true that shes had a great row with michael said he
thoughtfully

if she would she could be useful i said

i believe though that michael wrote that letter

so do i but i mean to know for certain i shall go sapt

no i shall go said he

you may go as far as the gate

i shall goto the summerhouse

im hanged if you shall

i rose and leant my back against the mantelpiece

sapt i believe in that woman and i shall go

i dont believe in any woman said sapt and you shant go

i either goto the summerhouse or back to england said i

sapt began to know exactly how far he could lead or drive and when he
must follow

were playing against time i added everyday we leave the king
where he is there is fresh risk everyday i masquerade like this there
is fresh risks apt we must play high we must force the game

so be i the said with a sigh

to cut the story short at half past eleven that nights apt and i
mounted our horses fritz was again left on guard our destination not
being revealed to him it was a very dark night i wore no sword but i
carried a revolver along knife and a bullseye lantern we arrived
outside the gate i dismounted sap the ld out his hand

i shall wait here he said if i hear a shot ill

stay where you are its the kings only chance you must nt come to
grief too

you re right lad goodluck

i pressed the little gate it yielded and i found myself in a wild sort
of shrubbery there was a grass grown path and turning to the right as
i had been bidden i followed it cautiously my lantern was closed the
revolver was in my hand i heard not a sound presently a large dark
object loomed out of the gloom ahead of me it was the summerhouse
reaching the steps i mounted them and found myself confronted by a
weak rickety wooden door which hung upon the latchi pushed it open
and walked in a woman flew to me and seized my hand

shut the door she whispered

i obeyed and turned the light of my lantern on her she was in evening
dress arrayed very sumptuously and her dark striking beauty was
marvellously displayed in the glare of the bullseye the summerhouse
was a bare little room furnished only with a couple of chairs and a
small iron table such as one sees in a teagarden or an openair cafe

dont talk she said weve no time listen i know you mr
ras send yll i wrote that letter at the dukes orders

so i thought said i

in twenty minutes three men will be here to kill you

three the three

yes you must begone by then if not tonight youll be killed

or they will

listenlisten when you re killed your body will be taken to a low
quarter of the town it will be found there michael will at once
arrest all your friends colonels apt and captain vont arlen heim
first proclaim a state of siege instr elsa u and send a messenger to
zenda the other three will murder the king in the castle and the duke
will proclaim either himself or the princess himself if he is strong
enough anyhow hell marry her and become king in fact and soon in
name do you see

its a pretty plot but why madame do you

say ima christian or say im jealous my god shall i see him marry
her now go but remember this is what i have to tell you that never
by night or by day are you safe three men follow you as a guard is it
not so well three follow them michaels three are never two hundred
yards from you your life is not worth a moment if ever they find you
alone now go stay the gate will be guarded by now go down softly go
past the summerhouse on for a hundred yards and youll find a ladder
against the wall get over it and fly for your life

and you i asked

i have my game to play too if he finds out what i have done we shall
not meet again if not i may yet but nevermind goat once

but what will you tell him

that you never came that you saw through the trick

i took her hand and kissed it

madame said i you have served the king well tonight where is he in
the castle

she sank her voice to a fearful whisper i listened eagerly

across the drawbridge you come to a heavy door behind that lie shark
whats that

there were steps outside

they re coming they re too soon heavens they re too soon and she
turned pale as death

they seem to me said i to be in the nick of time

close your lantern see theresa chink in the door can you see
them

i put my eye to the chink on the lowest step i saw three dim figures i
cocked my revolver antoinette hastily laid her hand on mine

you may kill one said she but what then

a voice came from outside a voice that spoke perfect english

mrr as send yll it said

i made no answer

we want to talk to you will you promise not to shoot till weve done

have i the pleasure of addressing mrd etc hard i said

nevermind names

then let mine alone

all rights i re ive an offer for you

i still had my eye to the chink the three had mounted two steps more
three revolvers pointed full at the door

will you let us in we pledge our honour to observe the truce

dont trust them whispered antoinette

we can speak through the door said i

but you might open it and fire objected d etc hard and though we
should finish you you might finish one of us will you give your honour
not to fire while we talk

dont trust them whispered antoinette again

a sudden ideas truck me i considered it for a moment it seemed
feasible

i give my honour not to fire before you do said i but i wont let
you in stand outside and talk

thats sensible he said

the three mounted the last step and stood just outside the door i
laid m year to the chink i could hear no words but d etc hard s head was
close to that of the taller of his companions de gaute ti guessed

hm private communications thought i then i said aloud

well gentlemen whats the offer

a safe conduct to the frontier and fifty thousand pounds english

no no whispered antoinette in the lowest of whispers they are
treacherous

that seems handsome said i reconnoiter ing through the chink they
were all close together just outside the door now

i had probed the hearts of the ruffians and i did not need antoinette s
warning they meant to rush me as soon as i was engaged in talk

give me a minute to consider said i and i thought i heard a laugh
outside

i turned to antoinette

standup close to the wall out of the line of fire from the door i
whispered

what are you going to do she asked in fright

youll see said i

i took up the little iron table it was not very heavy for a man of my
strength and i held it by the legs the top protruding in front of
me made a complete screen for my head and body i fastened my closed
lantern to my belt and put my revolver in a handy pocket suddenly i saw
the door move ever so slightly perhaps it was the wind perhaps it was
a hand trying it outside

i drew back as far as i could from the door holding the table in the
position that i have described then i called out

gentlemen i accept your offer relying on your honour if you will
open the door

open it yourself said d etc hard

it opens outwards said i stand back a little gentlemen or i shall
hit you when i open it

i went and fumbled with the latch then i stole back to my place on
tiptoe

icant open it i cried the latch has caught

tu till open it cried d etc hard nonsense berson in why not are
you afraid of one man

i smiled to myself an instant later the door was flung back the gleam
of a lantern showed me the three close together outside their
revolvers levelled with a shout i charged at my utmost pace across the
summerhouse and through the doorway three shots rang out and battered
into my shield another moment and i leapt out and the table caught
them full and square and in a tumbling swearing struggling mass they
and i and that brave table rolled down the steps of the summerhouse to
the ground below antoinette dem au ban shrieked but i rose to my feet
laughing aloud

de gaute t and berson inlay like men stunned d etc hard was under the
table but as i rose he pushed it from him and fired again i raised
my revolver and took a snapshot i heard him curse and then iran like
ah are laughing as i went past the summerhouse and along by the wall
i heard steps behind me and turning round i fired again for luck the
steps ceased

please god said is he told me the truth about the ladder for the
wall was high and topped with iron spikes

yes there it was i was up and over in a minute doubling back i saw
the horses then i heard a shot it was sap the had heard us and was
battling and raging with the locked gate hammering it and firing into
the keyhole like a man possessed he had quite forgotten that he was
not to take part in the fight where at i laughed again and said as i
clapped him on the shoulder

come home to bed old chap ive got the finest tea table story that
ever you heard

he started and cried you re safe and wrung my hand but a moment
later he added

and what the devil are you laughing at

four gentlemen round a tea table said i laughing still for it had
been uncommonly ludicrous to see the formidable three altogether routed
and scattered with no more deadly weapon than an ordinary tea table

moreover you will observe that i had honourably kept my word and not
fired till they did



chapter

a great chance for a villain


it was the custom that the prefect of police should send every afternoon
a report to me on the condition of the capital and the feeling of the
people the document included also an account of the movements of any
persons whom the police had received instructions to watch since i had
been instr elsa us apt had been in the habit of reading the report and
telling me any items of interest which it might contain on the day
after my adventure in the summerhouse he came in as i was playing a
hand of e carte with fritz vont arlen heim

the report is rather full of interest this afternoon he observed
sitting down

do you find i asked any mention of a certain fracas

he shook his head with a smile

i find this first he said his highness the duke of str elsa u left
the city so far as it appears suddenly accompanied by several of his
household his destination is believed to be the castle of zenda but
the party travelled by road and not by train mm de gaute t berson in
and d etc hard followed an hour later the last named carrying his armin
a sling the cause of his wound is not known but it is suspected that
he has fought a duel probably incidental to a love affair

that is remotely true i observed very well pleased to find that i
had left my mark on the fellow

then we come to this pursued sapt madame dem au ban whose
movements have been watched according to instructions left by train at
midday she took a ticket for dresden

its an old habit of hers said i

the dresden train stopsat zenda an acute fellow this and finally
listen to this the state of feeling in the city is not satisfactory
the king is much criticized you know hes told to be quite frank
for taking no steps about his marriage from enquiries among the
entourage of the princess flavia her royal highness is believed to be
deeply offended by there miss ness of his majesty the common people are
coupling her name with that of the duke of str elsa u and the duke gains
much popularity from the suggestion i have caused the announcement that
the king gives a ball tonight in honour of the princess to be widely
diffused and the effect is good

that is news to me said i

oh the preparations are all made laughed fritz ive seen to that

sapt turned to me and said in a sharp decisive voice

you must make love to her tonight you know

i think it is very likely i shall if i see her alone said i hang
its apt you dont suppose i find it difficult

fritz whistled a bar or two then he said youll find it only too
easy look here i hate telling you this but i must the countess helga
told me that the princess had become most attached to the king since
the coronation her feelings have undergone a marked development its
quite true that she is deeply wounded by the kings apparent neglect

here sa kettle of fish i groaned

tut tuts aids apt i suppose youve made pretty speeches to a girl
before now thats all she wants

fritz himself a lover understood better my distress he laid his hand
on my shoulder but said nothing

i think though pursued that coldblooded olds apt that you d
better make your offer tonight

good heavens

or any rate go near it and i shall send a semi official to the
papers

ill do nothing of the sort no more will you said ii utterly
refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess

sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes as low cunning smile passed
over his face

all right lad all right said he we must nt press you too hard
soothe her down abit if you can you know now for michael

oh damn michael said i hell do tomorrow here fritz come for a
stroll in the garden

sapt at once yielded his rough manner covered a wonderful tact and
as i came to recognize more and more a remarkable knowledge of human
nature why did he urge me so little about the princess because he
knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his
arguments and that the less i thought about the thing the more likely
was i to do i the must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the
princess but that went for nothing with him can i say confidently
that he was wrong if the king were restored the princess must turn to
him either knowing or not knowing the change and if the king were not
restored to us it was a subject that we had never yet spoken of but i
had an idea that in such a cases apt meant to seat me on the throne of
ruritan i a for the term of my life he would have set satan himself there
sooner than that pupil of his black michael


the ball was a sumptuous affair i opened it by dancing a quadrille
with flavia then i waltzed with her curious eyes and eager whispers
attended us we went into supper and halfway through i half mad by
then for her glance had answered mine and her quick breathing met my
stammered sentences i rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd
and taking the red rose that i wore flung the ribbon with its jewelled
badge round her neck in a tumult of applause is at down i saws apt
smiling over his wine and fritz frowning the rest of the meal passed
in silence neither flavian or i could speak fritz touched me on the
shoulder and i rose gave her my armand walked down the hall into a
little room where coffee was served to us the gentlemen and ladies in
attendance withdrew and we were alone

the little room had french windows opening on the gardens the night was
fine cool and fragrant flavia sat down and i stood opposite her i
was struggling with myself if she had not looked at me i believe that
even then i should have won my fight but suddenly involuntarily she
gave me one brief glance a glance of question hurriedly turned aside
a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek and she
caught her breath ah if you had seen her i forgot the king in zenda
i forgot the king instr elsa us he was a princess and ian impostor
do you think i remembered that i threw myself on my knee and seized
her hands in mine i said nothing why should i the soft sounds of the
night set my wooing to a wordless melody as i pressed my kisses on her
lips

she pushed me from her crying suddenly

a his it true or is it only because you must

its true i said in low smothered tones true that iloveyou more
than life or truth or honour

she set no meaning to my words treating them as one of loves sweet
extravagances she came close to me and whispered

oh if you were not the king then i could show you how iloveyou how
is it that iloveyou now rudolf

now

yes just lately ii never did before

pure triumph filled me it was i rudolf ras send yll who had won her i
caught her round the waist

you didnt love me before i asked

she looked up into my face smiling as she whispered

it must have been your crown i felt it first on the coronation day

never before i asked eagerly

she laughed low

you speak as if you would be pleased to hear me say yes to that she
said

would yes be true

yes i just heard her breathe and she went on in an instant be
careful rudolf be careful dear he will be mad now

what michael if michael were the worst

what worse is there

there was yet a chance for me controlling myself with a mighty effort
i took my hands off her and stood a yard or two away i remember now the
note of the wind in the elm trees outside

if i were not the king i began if i were only a private
gentleman

before i could finish her hand was in mine

if you were a convict in the prison of str elsa u you would be my king
she said

and under my breath i groaned god forgive me and holding her hand
in mine i said again

if i were not the king

hush hush she whispered i dont deserve it i dont deserve to be
doubted ah rudolf does a woman who marries without love look on the
man as i look on you

and she hid her face from me

for more than a minute we stood there together and i even with my arm
about her summoned up what honour and conscience her beauty and the
toils that i was in had left me

flavia i said in a strange dry voice that seemed not my own i am
not

as i spoke as she raised here yes to me there was a heavy step on the
gravel outside andaman appeared at the window a little cry burst
from flavia as she sprang back from me my half finished sentence died
on my lips sapt stood there bowing low but with astern frown on his
face

a thousand pardons sire said he but his eminence the cardinal has
waited this quarter of an hour to offer his respectful adieu to your
majesty

i me this eye full and square and i read in it an angry warning how
long he had been a listen erik new not but he had come in upon us in
the nick of time

we must not keep his eminence waiting said i

but flavia in whose love the relay noshame with radiant eyes and
blushing face held out her hand to sapt she said nothing but no
man could have missed her meaning who had ever seen a woman in the
exultation of love as our yet sad smile passed over the old soldiers
face and there was tenderness in his voice as bending to kiss her
hand he said

in joy and sorrow in good times and bad god save your royal
highness

he paused and added glancing at me and drawing himself up to military
erect ness

but before all comes the king god save the king

and flavia caught at my hand and kissed it murmuring

a men good god a men

we went into the ballroom again forced to receive adieu si was
separated from flavia everyone when they left me went to hers apt
was out and in of the throng and where he had been glances smiles
and whispers were rife i doubted not that true to his relentless
purpose he was spreading the news that he had learnt to uphold
the crown and beat black michael that was his one resolve flavia
myself ay and the real king in zenda were pieces in his game and
pawns have no business with passions not even at the walls of the
palace did he stop for when at last i handed flavia down the broad
marble steps and into her carriage there was a great crowd awaiting
us and we were welcomed with deafening cheers what could i do had i
spoken then they would have refused to believe that i was not the king
they might have believed that the king had run mad by s apts devices
and my own ungoverned passion i had been forced on and the wayback had
closed behind me and the passion still drove me in the same direction
as the devices seduced me i faced all str elsa u that night as the king
and the accepted suitor of the princess flavia

at last at three in the morning when the cold light of dawning day
began to steal in i was in my dressing room and sapt alone was with
me is at like amanda zed staring into the fire he puffed a this
pipe fritz was gone to bed having almost refused to speak to me on
the table by melay arose it had been in flavia s dress and as we
parted she had kissed it and given it to me

sapt advanced his hand towards the rose but with a quick movement i
shut mine down upon it

thats mine i said not yours nor the kings either

we struck a good blow for the king tonight said he

i turned on him fiercely

whats to prevent me striking a blow for myself i said

he nodded his head

i know whats in your mind he said yes lad but you rebound in
honour

have you left me any honour

oh come to playa little trick on a girl

you can spare me that colonels apt if you would not have me utterly a
villain if you would not have your king rot in zenda while michael and
i play for the great stake outside you follow me

ayi follow you

we must act and quickly you saw tonight you heard tonight

i did said he

your cursed acuteness told you what i should do well leave me here a
week and theres another problem for you do you find the answer

yes i find i the answered frowning heavily but if you did that
you d have to fight me first and kill me

well and if i had or a score of men i tell you i could raise all
str elsa u on you in an hour and choke you with your lies yes your mad
lies in your mouth

its gospel truth he said thanks to my advice you could

i could marry the princess and send michael and his brother together
to

im not denying it lad said he

then in gods name i cried stretching out my hands to him let us
goto zenda and crush this michael and bring the king back to his own
again the old fellow stood and looked at me for full a minute

and the princess he said

i bowed my head to meet my hands and crushed the rose between my
fingers and my lips

if el this hand on my shoulder and his voice sounded husky a she
whispered low in m year

before god you re the finest elph berg of them all but i have eaten
of the kings bread and i am the kings servant come we willgoto
zenda

and i looked up and caught him by the hand and the eyes of both of us
were wet




chapter

hunting a very big boar


the terrible temptation which was as sailing me will now be understood
i would so force michaels hand that he must kill the king i was in a
position to bid him defiance and tighten my grasp on the crown not for
its own sake but because the king of ruritan i a was to wed the princess
flavia what of sapt and fritz ah but a man can not beheld to write
down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when
an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them yet unless
he sets up as asain the need not hate himself for them he is better
employed as it humbly seems to me in giving thanks that power to
resist was vouchsafed to him than in fretting over wicked impulses
which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the
weakness of our nature

it was a fine bright morning when i walked unattended to the
princess s house carrying a nosegay in my hand policy made excuses
for love and every attention that i paid her while it riveted my own
chains bound closer to me the people of the great city who worshipped
her i found fritz sin am or at a the countess helga gathering blooms in
the garden for her mistress swear and prevailed on her to take mine in
their place the girl was rosy with happiness for fritz in his turn
had not wasted his evening and no darkshadow hungover his wooing
save the hatred which the duke of str elsa u was known to bear him

and that she said with a mischievous smile your majesty has made
of no moment yes i will take the flowers shall i tell you sire what
is the first thing the princess does with them

we were talking on abroad terrace that ran along the back of the house
and a window above our heads stood open

madame cried the countess merrily and flavia herself looked out i
bared my head and bowed she wore a white gown and her hair was loosely
gathered in a knots he kissed her hand to me crying

bring the king up helga ill give him some coffee

the countess with a gay glance led the way and took me into flavia s
morning room and left alone we greeted one another as lovers are
wont then the princess laid two letters before me one was from black
michael a most courteous request that she would honour him by spending
a day a this castle of zenda as had been her custom once a year in the
summer when the place and its gardens were in the height of their great
beauty i threw the letter down in disgust and flavia laughed at me
then growing grave again she pointed to the other sheet

i dont know who that comes from she said read it

i knew in a moment there was no signature at all this time but the
handwriting was the same as that which had told me of the snare in the
summerhouse it was antoinette dem au bans

i have no cause to love you it ran but god forbid that you should
fall into the power of the duke accept no invitations of his go
nowhere without a large guard a regiment is not too much to make you
safe show this if you can to him who reigns instr elsa u

why doesnt it say the king asked flavia leaning over my shoulder
so that the ripple of her hair played on my cheek is it a hoax

as you value life and more than life my queen i said obey it to
the very letter a regiment shall camp round your house today see that
you do not go out unless well guarded

an order sire she asked a little rebellious

yes an order madame if you love me

ah she cried and i could not but kiss her

you know who sent it she asked

i guess said i it is from a good friend and i fear an unhappy
woman you must be ill flavia and unable to goto zenda make your
excuses as cold and formal as you like

so you feel strong enough to anger michael she said with a proud
smile

im strong enough for anything while you are safe said i

soon i to re myself away from her and then without consulting sapt i
took my way to the house of marshal strake nc zi had seen something
of the old general and i liked and trusted him sapt was less
enthusiastic but i had learnt by now that sapt was best pleased when
he could do everything and jealousy played some part in his views as
things were now i had more work than sapt and fritz could manage for
they must come with me to zenda and i wanted a man to guard what i
loved most in all the world and suffer me to set about my task of
releasing the king with a quiet mind

the marshal received me with most loyal kindness to some extent i took
him into my confidence i charged him with the care of the princess
looking him full and significantly in the face as i bade him let no one
from her cousin the duke approach her unless he himself were there and
a dozen of his men with him

you maybe rights i re said he shaking his greyhead sadly i have
known better men than the duke do worse things than that for love

i could quite appreciate the remark but i said

theres something beside love marshal loves for the heart is there
nothing my brother might like for his head

i pray that you wrong him sire

marshal im leaving str elsa u for a few days every evening i will
send a courier to you if for three days none comes you will publish an
order which i will give you depriving duke michael of the governorship
of str elsa u and appointing you in his place you will declare a state of
siege then you will send word to michael that you demand an audience of
the king you follow me

ay sire

in twenty four hours if he does not produce the king i laid my
hand on his knee then the king is dead and you will proclaim the
next heir you know who that is

the princess flavia

and swear to me on your faith and honour and by the fear of the living
god that you will standby her to the death and kill that reptile and
seather where is it now

on my faith and honour and by the fear of god is wear it and may
almighty god preserve your majesty for i think that you go on an errand
of danger

i hope that no life more precious than mine maybe demanded said i
rising then i held out my hand to him

marshal i said in days to come it maybe i know not that you
will hear strange things of the man who speaks to you now let him be
what he may and who he may what say you of the manner in which he has
borne himself asking instr elsa u

the oldman holding my hand spoke to me man to man

i have known many of the elph bergs said he and i have seen you
and happen what may you have borne yourself as a wise king and a brave
man ay and you have proved as courteous a gentleman and as gallant a
lover as any that have been of the house

be that my epitaph said i when the time comes that another sits on
the throne of ruritan i a

godsend a far day and may i not see it said he

i was much moved and the marshal sworn face twitched is at down and
wrote my order

i can hardly yet write said i my finger is stiff still

it was in fact the first time that i had ventured to write more than
a signature and inspite of the pains i had taken to learn the kings
hand i was not yet perfect in it

indeed sire he said it differs a little from your ordinary
handwriting it is unfortunate for it may lead to a suspicion of
forgery

marshal said i with a laugh what use are the guns of str elsa u if
they cant assuage a little suspicion

he smiled grimly and took the paper

colonels apt and fritz vont arlen heim go with me i continued

you goto seek the duke he asked in a low tone

yes the duke and someone else of whom i have need and who is at
zenda i replied

i wish i could go with you he cried tugging a this white moustache
id like to strike a blow for you and your crown

i leave you what is more than my life and more than my crown said i
because you are the man i trust more than all other in ruritan i a

i will deliver her to you safe and sound said he and failing that
i will make her queen

we parted and i returned to the palace and told sapt and fritz what
i had done sapt had a few faults to find and a few grumbles to
utter this was merely what i expected for sapt liked to be consulted
beforehand not informed afterwards but on the whole he approved of my
plans and his spirits rose high as the hour of action drew nearer and
nearer fritz too was ready though he poor fellow risked more than
sapt did for he was a lover and his happiness hung in the scale yet
how i envied him for the triumphant issue which would crown him with
happiness and unite him to his mistress the success for which we were
bound to hope and strive and struggle meant to me sorrow more certain
and greater than if i were doomed to fail he understood something of
this for when we were alone save for olds apt who was smoking at the
other end of the room he passed his arm through mine saying

its hard for you dont think i dont trust you i know you have
nothing but true thoughts in your heart

but i turned away from him thankful that he could not see what my heart
held but only be witness to the deeds that my hands were to do

yet even he did not understand for he had not dared to lift his eyes to
the princess flavia as i had lifted mine

our plans were now all made even as we proceeded to carry them out and
as they will hereafter appear the next morning we were to start on the
hunting excursion i had made all arrangements for being absent and
now there was only one thing left to do the hardest the most
heartbreaking as evening fell i drove through the busy streets to
flavia s residence i was recognized as i went and heartily cheered i
played my part and made shift to look the happy lover inspite of my
depression i was almost amused at the coolness and delicate hauteur
with which my sweet lover received me she had heard that the king was
leaving str elsa u on a hunting expedition

i regret that we can not am use your majesty here instr elsa us he said
tapping her foot lightly on the floor i would have offered you more
entertainment but i was foolish enough to think

well what i asked leaning over her

that just for a day or two after after last night you might be happy
without much gaiety and she turned pettis hly from me as she added i
hope the boars will be more engrossing

im going after a very big boar said i and because i could not help
it i began to play with her hair but she moved her head away

are you offended with me i asked in feigned surprise for i could
not resist tormenting her a little i had never seen her angry and
every fresh aspect of her was a delight to me

what right have i to be offended true you said last night that every
hour away from me was wasted but a very big boar that sa different
thing

perhaps the boar will hunt me i suggested perhaps flavia hell
catch me

she made no answer

you are not touched even by that danger

still she said nothing and i stealing round found here yes full of
tears

you weep for my danger

then she spoke very low

this is like what you used to be but not like the king the king ii
have come to love

with a sudden great groan i caught her to my heart

my darling i cried forgetting everything but her did you dream
that i left you to go hunting

what then rudolf ah you re not going

well it is hunting i goto seek michael in his lair

she had turned very pale

so you see sweet i was not so poor a lover as you thought me i
shall not belong gone

you will write to me rudolf

i was weak but i could not say a word to stir suspicion in her

ill send you all my heart everyday said i

and youll run no danger

none that i need not

and when will you be back ah how long will it be

when shall i be back i repeated

yes yes dont belong dear dont be longish ant sleep while
you re away

i dont know when i shall be back said i

soon rudolf soon

god knows my darling but if never

hush hush and she pressed her lips to mine

if never i whispered you must take my place youll be the only one
of the house then you must reign and not weep for me

for a moment she drew herself up like a very queen

yes i will she said i will reign i will do my part though all my
life will be empty and my heart dead yet ill do it

she paused and sinking against me again wailed softly

come soon come soon

carried away i cried loudly

as god lives i yes i myself will see you once more before i die

what do you means he exclaimed with wondering eyes but i had no
answer for her and she gazed at me with her wondering eyes

i dared not ask her to forget she would have found it an insult i
could not tell her then who and what i was she was weeping and i had
but to dry her tears

shall a man not comeback to the loveliest lady in all the wide world
said i a thousand michaels should not keep me from you

she clung to me a little comforted

you wont let michael hurt you

no sweetheart

or keep you from me

no sweetheart

nor anyone else

and again i answered

no sweetheart

yet there was one not michael who if he lived must keep me from
her and for whose life i was going forth to stake my own and his
figure the li the buoyant figure i had met in the woods of zenda the
dull inert mass i had left in the cellar of the hunting lodge seemed
to rise double shaped before me and to come between us thrusting
itself in even where she lay pale exhausted fainting in my arms and
yet looking up at me with those eyes that bore such love as i have never
seen and haunt me now and will till the ground closes over me and
who knows perhaps beyond




chapter

i receive a visitor and bait a hook


about five miles from zenda on the opposite side from that on which
the castle is situated the relies a large tract of wood it is rising
ground and in the centre of the demesne on the top of the hill stands
a fine modern chateau the property of a distant kinsman of fritz s the
count stanislas vont arlen heim count stanislas himself was a student
and a recluse he seldom visited the house and had on fritz s request
very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and
my party this then was our destination chosen ostensibly for the
sake of the boar hunting for the wood was carefully preserved and
boars once common all over ruritan i a were still to be found there
in considerable numbers really because it brought us within striking
distance of the duke of str elsa us more magnificent dwelling on the
other side of the town a large party of servants with horses and
luggage started early in the morning we followed at midday travelling
by train for thirty miles and then mounting our horses to ride the
remaining distance to the chateau

we were a gallant party besides sapt and fritz i was accompanied by
ten gentlemen everyone of them had been carefully chosen and no less
carefully sounded by my two friends and all were devotedly attached to
the person of the king they were told apart of the truth the attempt
on my life in the summerhouse was revealed to them as a spur to their
loyalty and an incitement against michael they were also informed that
a friend of the kings was suspected to be forcibly confined within the
castle of zenda his rescue was one of the objects of the expedition
but it was added the kings main desire was to carry into effect
certain steps against his treacherous brother as to the precise nature
of which they could not at present be further enlightened enough that
the king commanded their services and would relyon their devotion when
occasion arose to call for it young well bred brave and loyal they
asked no more they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience and
prayed for a fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it

thus the scene was shifted from st rels auto the chateau of t arlen heim
and castle of zenda which frowned at us across the valley i tried to
shift my thoughts also to forget my love and to bendall my energies
to the task before me it was to get the king out of the castle alive
force was useless in some trick lay the chance and i had already an
inkling of what we must do but i was terribly hampered by the publicity
which attended my movements michael must know by now of my expedition
and i knew michael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by
the feint of the boar hun the would understand very well what the real
quarry was that however must be risked that and all it might mean
for sapt no less than myself recognized that the present state of
things had become unendurable and there was one thing that i dared to
calculate on not as i now know without warrant it was this that
black michael would not believe that i meant well by the king he could
not appreciate i will not say an honest man for the thoughts of my
own heart have been revealed but a man acting honestly he saw
my opportunity as i had seen it ass apt had seen i the knew the
princess nay and i declare that a sneaking sort of pity for him
invaded me in his way he loved her he would think that sapt and fritz
could be bribed so the bribe was large enough thinking thus would he
kill the king my rival and my danger ay verily that he would with
as little compunction a she would killara tbu the would kill rudolf
ras send yll first if he could and nothing but the certainty of being
utterly damned by the release of the king alive and his restoration to
the throne would drive him to throwaway the trump card which he held in
reserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor ras send yll
musing on all this as i rode along i took courage

michael knew of my coming sure enough i had not been in the house an
hour when an imposing embassy arrived from him he did not quite reach
the impudence of sending my would be assassins but he sent the other
three of his famous six the three ruritan ian gentlemen lau engram
k raf stein and rupert hentz au a fine strapping trio they were
splendidly horse d and admirably equipped young rupert who looked
a daredevil and could not have been more than twenty two or
twenty three took the lead and made us the neatest speech where in
my devoted subject and loving brother michael of str elsa u prayed me to
pardon him for not paying his addresses in person and further for not
putting his castle at my disposal the reason for both of these apparent
dereliction s being that he and several of his servants lay sick of
scarlet fever and were in a very sad and also a very infectious state
so declared young rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip
and a toss of his thick hair he was a handsome villain and the gossip
ran that many a lady had troubled her heart for him already

if my brother has scarlet fever said i he is nearer my complexion
than he is wont to be my lord i trust he does not suffer

he is able to attend to his affairs sire

i hope all beneath your roof are not sick what of my good friends de
gaute t berson in and d etc hard i heard the last had suffered a hurt

lau engram and k raf stein looked glum and uneasy but young rupert s smile
grew broader

he hopes soon to find a medicine for it sire he answered

and iburst out laughing for i knew what medicine d etc hard longed
for it is called revenge

you will dine with us gentlemen i asked

young rupert was profuse in apologies they had urgent duties at the
castle

then said i with a wave of my hand to our next meeting gentlemen
may it make us better acquainted

we will pray your majesty for a nearly opportunity quoth rupert
airily and he strode past sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that
i saw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night

for my part if a man must needs be a knave i would have him a debonair
knave and i liked rupert hentz au better than his long faced close eyed
companions it makes yours in no worse as i conceive to do it ala
mode and stylishly

now it was a curious thing that on this first night instead of eating
the excellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me i must needs leave my
gentlemen to eat it alone under s apts presiding care and ride myself
with fritz to the town of zenda and a certain little inn that i knew
of there was little danger in the excursion the evenings were long and
light and the road this side of zenda well frequented so off we rode
with a groom behind us i muffled myself up in a big cloak

fritz said i as we entered the town there san uncommonly pretty
girl at this inn

how do you know he asked

because ive been there said i

since he began

no before said i

but theyll recognize you

well of course they will now dont argue my goodfellow but listen
to me were two gentlemen of the kings household and one of us has a
toothache the other will order a private room and dinner and further
a bottle of the best wine for the sufferer and if he be as clever a
fellow as i take him for the pretty girl and no other will wait on us

what if she wont objected fritz

my dear fritz said i if she wont for you she will for me

we were at the inn nothing of me but my eyes was visible as i walked
in the landlady received us two minutes later my little friend ever
i fear me on the lookout for such guests as might prove amusing made
her appearance dinner and the wine were ordered is at down in the
private room a minute later fritz came in

shes coming he said

if she were not i should have to doubt the countess helga s taste

she came in i gave her time to set the wine down i didnt want it
dropped fritz poured out a glass and gave it to me

is the gentleman in great pain the girl asked sympathetically

the gentleman is no worse than when he saw you last said i throwing
away my cloak

she started with a little shriek then she cried

it was the king then it old mother so the moment i saw his picture
oh sir forgive me

faith you gave me nothing that hurt much said i

but the things we said

i forgive them for the thing you did

i must go and tell mother

stop said i assuming a graver air we are not here for sport
tonight go and bring dinner and not a word of the king being here

she came back in a few minutes looking grave yet very curious

well how is johann i asked beginning my dinner

oh that fellow sir my lord king i mean

sir will do please how is he

we hardly see him now sir

and why not

it old him he came too often sir said she tossing her head

so he sulks and stays away

yessir

but you could bring him back i suggested with a smile

perhaps i could said she

i know your powers you see said i and she blushed with pleasure

its not only that sir that keeps him away hes very busy at the
castle

but theres no shooting on now

no sir but he sin charge of the house

johann turned housemaid

the little girl was brimming over with gossip

well there are no others said she theres not a woman there not
as a servant i mean they do say but perhaps its false sir

lets have it for what its worth said i

indeed im ashamed to tell you sir

oh see im looking at the ceiling

they do say there is a lady there sir but except for her theres
not a woman in the place and johann has to wait on the gentlemen

poor johann he must be overworked yet im sure he could find half an
hour to come and see you

it would depend on the time sir perhaps

do you love him i asked

not i sir

and you wish to serve the king

yessir

then tell him to meet you at the second milestone out of zenda tomorrow
evening atten oclock say youll be there and will walk home with
him

do you mean him harm sir

not if he will do as ibid him but i think ive told you enough my
pretty maid see that you do as ibid you and mind no one is to know
that the king has been here

i spoke a little sternly for there is seldom harm in infusing a little
fear into a womans liking for you and i softened the effect by giving
her a handsome present then we dined and wrapping my cloak about
my face with fritz leading the way we went downstairs to our horses
again

it was but half past eight and hardly yet dark the streets were full
for such a quiet little place and i could see that gossip was all agog
with the king on one side and the duke on the other zenda felt itself
the centre of all ruritan i a we jogged gently through the town but set
our horses to a sharper pace when we reached the open country

you want to catch this fellow johann asked fritz

ay and i fancy ive baited the hook right our little delilah will
bring our samson it is not enough fritz to have no women in a house
though brother michael shows some wisdom there if you want safety you
must have none within fifty miles

none nearer than str elsa u for instance said poor fritz with a
lovelorn sigh

we reached the avenue of the chateau and were soon at the house as the
hoofs of our horses sounded on the gravels apt rushed out to meet us

thank god you re safe he cried have you seen anything of them

of whom i asked dismounting

he drew usa side that the grooms might not hear

lad he said to me you must not ride about here unless with half a
dozen of us you know among our men at all young fellow berne n stein by
name

i knew him he was a fine strapping youngman almost of my height and
of light complexion

he lies in his room upstairs with a bullet through his arm

the deuce he does

after dinner he strolled out alone and went a mile or so into the
wood and a she walked he though the saw three men among the trees
and one levelled a gun at him he had no weapon and he started at a run
back towards the house but one of them fired and he was hit and had
much a do to reach here before he fainted by goodluck they feared to
pursue him nearer the house

chapter

an improvement on jacobs ladder


in the morning of the day after that on which is wore my oath against
the six i gave certain orders and then rested in greater contentment
than i had known for sometime i was at work and work though it
can not cure love is yet a narcotic to it so that sapt who grew
feverish marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine
listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow
voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy thus was i engaged when
young rupert hentz au who feared neither mann or devil and rode through
the demesne where every tree might hide a marksman for all he knew as
though it had been the park at str elsa u cantered up to where i lay
bowing with burlesque deference and craving private speech with me
in order to deliver a message from the duke of str elsa ui made all
withdraw and then he said seating himself by me

the king is in love it seems

not with life my lord said i smiling

it is well here joined come we are alone ras send yll

i rose to a sitting posture

whats the matter he asked

i was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse my lord
if you do not know how to address the king my brother must find another
messenger

why keep up the farce he asked negligently dusting his boot with his
glove

because it is not finished yet and meanwhile ill choose my own name

oh so be it yeti spoke in love for you for indeed you area man
after my own heart

saving my poor honesty said i maybe i am but that i keep faith
with men and honour with women maybe i am my lord

he darted a glance at me a glance of anger

is your mother dead said i

ay shes dead

she may thank god said i and i heard him curse me softly well
whats the message i continued

i had touched him on the raw for all the world knew he had broken his
mothers heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house and his airy
manner was gone for the moment

the duke offers you more than i would he growled a halter for
you sire was my suggestion but he offers you safe conduct across the
frontier and a million crowns

i prefer your offer my lord if i am bound to one

you refuse

of course

it old michael you would and the villain his temper restored
gave me the sunniest of smiles the fact is between ourselves he
continued michael doesnt understand a gentleman

i began to laugh

and you i asked

i do he said well well the halter be it

im sorry you wont live to see it i observed

has his majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on
me

i would you were a few years older though

oh god gives years but the devil gives increase laughed he i can
hold my own

how is your prisoner i asked

the k

your prisoner

i forgot your wishes sire well he is alive

he rose to his feet i imitated him then with a smile he said

and the pretty princess faith ill wager the next elph berg will be
red enough for all that black michael will be called his father

i sprang a step towards him clenching my hand he did not move an inch
and his lip curled in insolent amusement

go while your skins whole i muttered he had repaid me with
interest my hit about his mother

then came the most audacious thing i have known in my life my friends
were some thirty yards away rupert called to a groom to bring him his
horse and dismissed the fellow with a crown the horse stood near i
stood still suspecting nothing rupert made as though to mount then
he suddenly turned to me his lefthand resting in his belt his right
outstretched shake hands he said

i bowed and did a she had foreseen i put my hands behind me quicker
than though this lefthand darted out at me and a small dagger flashed
in the air he struck me in the left shoulder had i not swerved it
had been my heart with a cry i staggered back without touching the
stirrup he leapt upon his horse and was off like a narrow pursued by
cries and revolver shots the last as useless as the first and i
sank into my chair bleeding profusely as i watched the devils brat
disappear down the long avenue my friends surrounded me and then i
fainted

i suppose that i was put to bed and the relay unconscious or half
conscious for many hours for it was night when i awoke to my full
mind and found fritz beside me i was weak and weary but he bade me be
of good cheer saying that my wound would soon heal and that meanwhile
all had gone well for johann the keeper had fallen into the snare we
had laid for him and was even now in the house

and the queer thing is pursued fritz that i fancy hes not
altogether sorry to find himself here he seems to think that when
black michael has brought off his coup witnesses of how it was
effected saving of course the six themselves will not beat a
premium

this idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build
hopes on his assistance i ordered him to be brought in at once sapt
conducted him and set him in a chair by my bedside he was sullen and
afraid but to say truth after young rupert s exploit we also had
our fears and if he got as far as possible from s apts formidable
six shooters apt kept him as far a she could from me moreover when he
came in his hands were bound but that i would not suffer

i need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the
fellow all of which were honourably observed and paid so that he lives
now in prosperity though where i may not mention and we were the more
free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a
wicked and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke
and of his own brother max than for any love of what was done but
he had persuaded all of his loyalty and though not in their secret
counsels was yet by his knowledge of their dispositions within the
castle able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices and
herein brief is his story

below the level of the ground in the castle approached by a flight of
stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge were situated
two small rooms cutout of the rock itself the outer of the two had no
windows but was always lighted with candles the inner had one square
window which gave upon the moat in the outer room the relay always
day and night three of the six and the instructions of duke michael
were that on any attack being made on the outer room the three were to
defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves
but so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced then
rupert hentz au ord etc hard for one of these two was always there
should leave the others to hold it as long as they could and himself
pass into the inner room and without more a do kill the king who
lay there well treated indeed but without weapons and with his arms
confined in fine steel chains which did not allow him to move his elbow
more than three inches from his side thus before the outer door were
stormed the king would be dead and his body for his body would be
evidence as damning as himself

nay sir said johann his highness has thought of that while the
two hold the outer room the one who has killed the king unlocks the
bars in the square window they turn on a hinge the window now gives
no light for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware and
this pipe which is large enough to let passthrough it the body of
a man passes into the moat coming to an end immediately above the
surface of the water so that there is no perceptible interval between
water and pipe the king being dead his murderer swiftly ties a weight
to the body and dragging it to the window raises it by a pulley for
lest the weight should prove too great d etc hard has provided one till
it is level with the mouth of the pipe he inserts the feet in the pipe
and pushes the body down silently without splash or sound it falls
into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat which is twenty
feet deep thereabouts this done the murderer cries loudly all s
well and himself slides down the pipe and the others if they can and
the attack is not too hot run to the inner room and seeking a moments
delay bar the door and in their turn slide down and though the king
rises not from the bottom they rise and swim round to the other side
where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes to haul them out
and horses and here if things go ill the duke will join them and seek
safety by riding but if all goes well they will return to the castle
and have their enemies in a trap that sir is the plan of his highness
for the disposal of the king in case of need but it is not to be used
till the last for as we all know he is not minded to kill the king
unless he can before or soon after kill you also sir now siri
have spoken the truth as god is my witness and i pray you to shield me
from the vengeance of duke michael for if after he knows what i have
done if all into his hands i shall pray for one thing out of all the
world a speedy death and that i shall not obtain from him

the fellows story was rudely told but our questions supplemented
his narrative what he had told us applied to an armed attack but if
suspicions were aroused and there came overwhelming force such for
instance as i the king could bring the idea of resistance would be
abandoned the king would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe
and here comes an ingenious touch one of the six would take his
place in the cell and on the entrance of the searchers loudly demand
release and redress and michael being summoned would confess to hasty
action but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour
of a lady in the castle this was antoinette dem au ban and he had
confined him there a she conceived he as lord of zenda had right to
do but he was now on receiving his apology content to let him go
and so end the gossip which to his highness s annoyance had arisen
concerning a prisoner in zenda and had given his visitors the trouble
of this enquiry the visitors baffled would retire and michael could
a this leisure dispose of the body of the king

sapt fritz and i in my bed looked round on one another in horror and
bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan whether i went
in peace or in war openly at the head of a corps or secretly by a
stealthy assault the king would be dead before i could come near him
if michael were stronger and overcame my party there would bean end
but if i were stronger i should have no way to punish him no means of
proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also on the other
hand i should be left asking ah for a moment my pulse quickened and
it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and
me he seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible at
the worst he would stand as well a she had stood before i crossed
his path with but one man between him and the throne and that man an
impostor at best there would be none left to stand against him i had
begun to think that black michael was over fond of leaving the fighting
to his friends but now i acknowledged that the brains if not the arms
of the conspiracy were his

does the king know this i asked

i and my brother answered johann put up the pipe under the orders
of my lord of hentz au he was on guard that day and the king asked my
lord what it meant faith he answered with his airy laugh its a
new improvement on the ladder of jacob whereby as you have read sire
men pass from the earth to heaven we thought it not meet that your
majesty should go in case sire you must go by the common route so
we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar can not stare
at you or in commode your passage that sire is the meaning of
that pipe and he laughed and bowed and prayed the kings leave to
replenish the kings glass for the king was at supper and the king
though he is a brave man as are all of his house grew red and then
white a she looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him
ah sir and the fellow shuddered it is not easy to sleep quiet in
the castle of zenda for all of them would as soon cut a mans throat
as playa game at cards and my lord rupert would choose it sooner for
a pastime than any other ay sooner than he would ruin a woman though
that he loves also

the man ceased and i bade fritz take him away and have him carefully
guarded and turning to him i added

if anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in zenda you may answer
yes but if any asks who the prisoner is do not answer for all my
promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as
to the prisoner of zenda ill kill you like a dog if the thing be so
much as breathed within the house

then when he was gone i looked at sapt

its a hard nut said i

so hard said he shaking his grizzled head that as i think this
time next year is like to find you still king of ruritan i a and he
broke out into curses on michaels cunning

i layback on my pillows

there seems tomei observed to be two ways by which the king can
come out of zenda alive one is by treachery in the dukes followers

you can leave that out said sapt

i hope not i rejoined because the other i was about to mention
is by a miracle from heaven




chapter

a night outside the castle


it would have surprised the good people of ruritan i a to know of the
foregoing talk for according to the official reports i had suffered a
grievous and dangerous hurt from an accidental spear thrust received in
the course of my sport i caused the bulletins to be of a very serious
character and created great public excitement whereby three things
occurred first i gravely offended the medical faculty of str elsa u by
refusing to summon to my bedside any of them save a youngman a friend
of fritz s whom we could trust secondly i received word from marshal
strake nc z that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his and
that the princess flavia was leaving fort arlen heim under his unwilling
escort news where at is trove not to be glad and proud and thirdly my
brother the duke of str elsa u although too well informed to believe the
account of the origin of my sickness was yet persuaded by the reports
and by my seeming in activity that i was in truth incapable of action
and that my life was in some danger this i learnt from the man johann
whom i was compelled to trust and send back to zenda whereby the way
rupert hentz au had him soundly flogged for daring to s mirch the morals
of zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love this from
rupert johann deeply resented and the dukes approval of it did more
to bind the keeper to my side than all my promises

on flavia s arrival i can not dwell her joy at finding me up and well
instead of on my back and fighting with death makes a picture that
even now dances before my eye still they grow too dim to see it and her
reproaches that i had not trusted even her must excuse the means i took
to quiet them in truth to have her with me once more was like a taste
of heaven to a damned soul the sweeter for the inevitable doom that
was to follow and i rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with
her and when i had wasted two days the duke of str elsa u arranged a
hunting party

the stroke was near now for sapt and i after anxious consultations
had resolved that we must risk a blow our resolution being clinched
by johanns news that the king grew peaked pale and ill and that his
health was breaking downunder his rigorous confinement now a man be
he king or no king may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman
from bullet or thrust as ro this life out in a cellar that thought
made prompt action advisable in the interests of the king from my own
point of view it grew more and more necessary for strake nc z urged on
me the need of a speedy marriage and my own inclinations seconded him
with such terrible insistence that i feared for my resolution i do not
believe that i should have done the deed i dreamt of but i might have
come to flight and my flight would have ruined the cause and yes i
am no saint ask my little sister in law and worse still might have
happened

it is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of a
country that the kings brother and the kings person at or in a time of
profound outward peace near a placid undisturbed country town under
semblance of amity should wage a desperate war for the person and life
of the king yet such was the struggle that began now between zenda and
t arlen heim when i look back on the time i seem to myself to have been
half mads apt has told me that i suffered no interference and listened
to no remonstrances and if ever a king of ruritan i a ruled like a
despot i was in those days the man look where i would i saw nothing
that made life sweet to me and i took my life in my hand and carried it
carelessly as am and angles an old glove at first they strove to guard
me to keep me safe to persuade me not to expose myself but when they
saw how i was set there grew up among them whether they knew the truth
or not a feeling that fate ruled the issue and that i must be left to
play my game with michael my own way

late next night i rose from table where flavia had sat by me and
conducted her to the door of her apartments there i kissed her hand
and bade her sleep sound and wake to happy days then i changed my
clothes and went outs apt and fritz were waiting for me with six men
and the horses over his saddles apt carried along coil of rope and
both were heavily armed i had with me a short stout cudgel and along
knife making a circuit we avoided the town and in an hour found
ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the castle of zenda the
night was dark and very stormy gusts of wind and spits of rain caught
us as we breasted the incline and the great trees moaned and sighed
when we came to a thick clump about a quarter of a mile from the
castle web a de our six friends hide there with the horses sapt had a
whistle and they could rejoin us in a few moments if danger came but
up to now we had met no one i hoped that michael was still off his
guard believing me to be safe in bed however that might be we gained
the top of the hill without accident and found ourselves on the edge of
the moat where it sweeps under the road separating the oldcastle
from it a tree stood on the edge of the bank and sapt silently and
diligently set to make fast the rope i stripped off my boots took a
pull at a flask of brandy loosened the knife in its sheath and took
the cudgel between my teeth then is hook hands with my friends not
heeding a last look of entreaty from fritz and laid hold of the rope i
was going to have a look at jacobs ladder

gently i lowered myself into the water though the night was wild the
day had been warm and bright and the water was not cold is truck out
and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me i could
see only three yards ahead i had then good hopes of not being seen
as i crept along close under the damp moss grown masonry there were
lights from the new part of the castle on the other side and now and
again i heard laughter and merry shouts i fancied i recognized young
rupert hentz a us ringing tones and pictured him flushed with wine
recalling my thoughts to the business in hand i rested a moment if
johanns description were right i must be near the window now very
slowly i moved and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape it was
the pipe curving from the window to the water about four feet of its
surface were displayed it was as big round ast women i was about to
approach it when i saw something else and my heart stood still
the nose of a boat protruded beyond the pipe on the other side and
listening intently i heard as light shuffle as of a man shifting his
position who was the man who guarded michaels invention was he awake
or was he asleep i felt if my knife were ready and trod water as
i did so i found bottom under my feet the foundations of the castle
extended some fifteen inches making a ledge and i stood on it out of
water from my armpits upwards then i crouched and peered through the
darkness under the pipe where curving it left a space

there was a man in the boat a rifle lay by him i saw the gleam of
the barrel here was the sentinel he sat very still i listened he
breathed heavily regularly monotonously by heaven he slept kneeling
on the shelf i drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two
feet of his he was a big man i saw it was max hol f the brother of
johann my hand stole to my belt and i drew out my knife of all the
deeds of my life i love the least to think of this and whether it were
the act of a manor a traitor i will not ask i said to myself it is
war and the kings life is the stake and i raised myself from beneath
the pipe and stood up by the boat which lay moored by the ledge
holding my breath i marked the spot and raised my arm the great fellow
stirred he opened his eyes wide wider he gasped in terror at my
face and clutched a this rifle is truck home and i heard the chorus of
a lovesong from the opposite bank

leaving him where he lay a huddled mass i turned to jacobs ladder
my time was short this fellows turn of watching might be over
directly and relief would come leaning over the pipe i examined it
from the end near the water to the top most extremity where it passed or
seemed to passthrough the masonry of the wall there was no break
in it no chink dropping on my knees i tested the underside and
my breath went quick and fast for on this lower side where the pipe
should have clung close to the masonry there was a gleam of light that
light must come from the cell of the king i set my shoulder against the
pipe and exerted my strength the chink widened a very very little
and hastily i desisted i had done enough to show that the pipe was not
fixed in the masonry at the lower side

then i heard a voice a harsh grating voice

well sire if you have had enough of my society i will leave you to
repose but i must fasten the little ornaments first

it was d etc hard i caught the english accent in a moment

have you anything to ask sire before we part

the kings voice followed it was his though it was faint and
hollow different from the merry tones i had heard in the glades of the
forest

pray my brother said the king to kill me i am dying by inches
here

the duke does not desire your death sire yet sneered d etc hard
when he does behold your path to heaven

the king answered

so be it and now if your orders allow it pray leave me

may you dream of paradise said the ruffian

the light disappeared i heard the bolts of the door run home and then
i heard the sobs of the king he was alone a she thought who dares
mock at him

i did not venture to speak to him the risk of some exclamation escaping
him in surprise was too great i dared do nothing that night and my
task now was to get myself away in safety and to carry off the carcass
of the deadman to leave him there would tell too much casting loose
the boat i got in the wind was blowing a gale now and there was
little danger of oars being heard i rowed swiftly round to where my
friends waited i had just reached the spot when aloud whistle sounded
over the moat behind me

hullo maxi heard shouted

i hailed sap tina low tone the rope came down it i edit round the
corpse and then went up it myself

whistle you too i whispered for our men and haul in the lineno
talk now

they hauled up the body just as it reached the road three men on
horseback swept round from the front of the castle we saw them but
being on foot ourselves we escaped their notice but we heard our men
coming up with a shout

the devil but its dark cried a ringing voice

it was young rupert a moment later shots rang out our people had met
them i started forward at a runs apt and fritz following me

thrust thrust cried rupert again and aloud groan following told
that he himself was not behind hand

im done rupert cried a voice they re three to one save
yourself

iran on holding my cudgel in my hand suddenly a horse came towards
me a man was on it leaning over his shoulder

are you cooked took raf stein he cried

there was no answer

i sprang to the horses head it was rupert hentz au

at last i cried

for we seemed to have him he had only his sword in his hand my men
were hot upon him sapt and fritz were running up i had outstripped
them but if they got close enough to fire he must die or surrender

at last i cried

its the play actor cried he slashing at my cudgel he cut it clean
in two and judging discretion better than death i ducked my head
and i blush to tell it scampered for my life the devil was in rupert
hentz au for he put spurs to his horse and i turning to look saw him
ride full gallop to the edge of the moat and leap in while the shots
of our party fell thick round him like hail with one gleam of moonlight
we should have riddled him with balls but in the darkness he won to
the corner of the castle and vanished from our sight

the deuce take him grinned sapt

its a pity said i that hesa villain whom have we got

we had lau engram and k raf stein they lay dead and concealment being
no longer possible we flung them with max into the moat and drawing
together in a compact body rode off down the hill and in our midst
went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen thus we travelled home
heavy at heart for the death of our friends sore uneasy concerning
the king and cut to the quick that young rupert had played yet another
winning hand with us

for my own part i was vexed and angry that i had killed no man in open
fight but only stabbed a knave in his sleep and i did not love to hear
rupert call me a play actor




chapter

i talk with a tempter


ruritan i a is not england or the quarrel between duke michael and myself
could not have gone on with the extraordinary incidents which marked
it without more public notice being directed to it duels were frequent
among all the upper classes and private quarrels between great men
kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents
nevertheless after the affray which i have just related such reports
began to circulate that i felt it necessary to be on my guard the death
of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives i
issued astern order declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented
licence the chancellor drew up the document for me and very well he
did it and forbidding it save in the gravest cases i sent a public
and stately apology to michael and he returned a deferential and
courteous reply to me for our one point of union was and it underlay
all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our
actions that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the
table he as well as i was a play actor and hating one another we
combined to dupe public opinion unfortunately however the necessity
for concealment involved the necessity of delay the king might die
in his prison or even be spirited off somewhere else it could not be
helped for a little while i was compelled to observe a truce and
my only consolation was that flavia most warmly approved of my edict
against duelling and when i expressed delight at having won her
favour prayed me if her favour were any motive to me to prohibit the
practice altogether

wait till we are married said i smiling

not the least peculiar result of the truce and of the secrecy which
dictated it was that the town of zenda became in the daytime i would
not have trusted far to its protection by night a sort of neutral zone
where both parties could safely go and i riding down one day with
flavia and sapt had an encounter with an acquaintance which presented
a ludicrous side but was at the same time embarrassing as i rode
along i meta dignified looking person driving in a two horse d
carriage he stopped his horses got out and approached me bowing low
i recognized the head of the str elsa u police

your majestys ordinance as to duelling is receiving our best
attention he assured me

if the best attention involved his presence in zenda i determined at
once to dispense with it

is that what brings you to zenda prefect i asked

why no sire i am here because i desired to oblige the british
ambassador

whats the british ambassador doing dans cette gale re said i
carelessly

a young countryman of his sire a man of some position is missing
his friends have not heard from him for two months and there is reason
to believe that he was last seen in zenda

flavia was paying little attention i dared not look at sapt

what reason

a friend of his in paris a certain m featherly has given us
information which makes it possible that he came here and the officials
of the railway recollect his name on some luggage

what was his name

ras send yll sire he answered and i saw that the name meant nothing
to him but glancing at flavia he lowered his voice a she went on
it is thought that he may have followed a lady here has your majesty
heard of a certain madame dem au ban

why yes said i my eye involuntarily travelling towards the castle

she arrived in ruritan i a about the same time as this ras send yll

i caught the prefects glance he was regarding me with enquiry writ
large on his face

sapt said ii must speak a word to the prefect will you ride on
a few paces with the princess and i added to the prefect come sir
what do you mean

he drew close to me and i bent in the saddle

if he were in love with the lady he whispered nothing has been
heard of him for two months and this time it was the eye of the
prefect which travelled towards the castle

yes the lady is there i said quietly but i dont suppose mr
ras send yll is that the name is

the duke he whispered does not like rivals sire

you re right there said i with all sincerity but surely you hint
at a very grave charge

he spread his hands out in apology i whispered in his ear

this is a grave matter go back to str elsa u

but sire if i have a clue here

go back to str elsa ui repeated tell the ambassador that you have a
clue but that you must be left alone for a week or two meanwhile ill
charge myself with looking into the matter

the ambassador is very pressing sir

you must quiet him come sir you see that if your suspicions are
correct it is an affair in which we must move with caution we can have
no scandal mind you return tonight

he promised to obey me and i rode on to rejoin my companions a little
easier in my mind enquiries after me must be stopped at all hazards for
a week or two and this clever official had come surprisingly near the
truth his impression might be useful someday but if he acted on it
now it might mean the worse to the king heartily did i curse george
featherly for not holding his tongue

well asked flavia have you finished your business

most satisfactorily said i come shall we turn round we are almost
trenching on my brothers territory

we were in fact at the extreme end of the town just where the hills
begin to mount towards the castle we cast our eyes up admiring the
massive beauty of the old walls and we saw a cortege winding slowly
down the hill on it came

let us go back said sapt

i should like to stay said flavia and i reined my horse beside hers

we could distinguish the approaching party now there came first two
mounted servants in black uniforms relieved only by a silver badge
these were followed by a car drawn by four horses on it under a
heavy p all lay a coffin behind it rode a man in plain black clothes
carrying his hat in his hands apt uncovered and we stood waiting
flavia keeping by me and laying her hand on my arm

it is one of the gentlemen killed in the quarrel i expect she said

i beckoned to a groom

ride and ask whom they escort i ordered

hero de up to the servants and i saw him pass on to the gentleman who
rode behind

its rupert of hentz au whispered sapt

rupert it was and directly afterwards waving to the procession to
standstill rupert trotted up to me he was in a frock coat tightly
buttoned and trousers he wore an aspect of sadness and he bowed with
profound respect yet suddenly he smiled and i smiled too for old
s apts hand lay in his left breast pocket and rupert and i both guessed
what lay in the hand inside the pocket

your majesty asks whom we escort said rupert it is my dear friend
albert of lau engram

sir said i no one regrets the unfortunate affair more than i my
ordinance which i mean to have obeyed is witness to it

poor fellow said flavia softly and i saw rupert s eyes flash at her
where at i grew red for if i had my way rupert hentz au should not
have defiled her by so much as a glance ye the did it and dared to let
admiration be seen in his look

your majesty swords are gracious he said i grieve for my friend
yet sire others must soon lie a she lies now

it is a thing we all do well to remember my lord i rejoined

even kings sire said rupert in a moralizing tone and olds apt
swore softly by my side

it is true said i how fares my brother my lord

he is better sire

i am rejoiced

he hopes soon to leave for str elsa u when his health is secured

he is only convalescent then

there remain one or two small troubles answered the insolent fellow
in the mildest tone in the world

express my earnest hope said flavia that they may soon cease to
trouble him

your royal highness swish is humbly my own said rupert with a
bold glance that brought a blush to flavia s cheek

i bowed and rupert bowing lower backed his horse and signed to his
party to proceed with a sudden impulse i rode after him he turned
swiftly fearing that even in the presence of the dead and before a
ladys eyes i meant him mischief

you fought as a brave man the other night i said come you are
young sir if you will delivery our prisoner alive to me you shall
come to no hurt

he looked at me with a mocking smile but suddenly hero de nearer to me

im unarmed he said and our olds apt there could pick me off in a
minute

im not afraid said i

no curse you he answered look here i made you a proposal from the
duke once

ill hear nothing from black michael said i

then hear one from me he lowered his voice to a whisper attack the
castle boldly lets apt and t arlen heim lead

go on said i

arrange the time with me

i have such confidence in you my lord

tu tim talking business now sapt there and fritz will fall black
michael will fall

what

black michael will fall like the dog he is the prisoner as you
call him will go by jacobs ladder ah you know that to hell two
men will be left i rupert hentz au and you the king of ruritan i a

he paused and the nina voice that quivered with eagerness added

isnt that a hand to playa throne and your princess and for me say
a competence and your majestys gratitude

surely i exclaimed while you re aboveground hell wants its
master

well think it over he said and look you it would take more than
a scruple or two to keep me from yonder girl and his evil eye flashed
again a the ri loved

get out of my reach said i and yet in a moment i began to laugh for
the very audacity of it

would you turn against your master i asked

he swore at michael for being what the offspring of a legal though
morgan atic union should not be called and said to me in an almost
confidential and apparently friendly tone

he gets in my way you know hesa jealous brute faith in early
stuck a knife into him last night he came most cursed lym al apropos

my temper was well under control now i was learning something

a lady i asked negligently

ay and a beauty he nodded but youve seen her

ah was it at a tea party when some of your friends got on the wrong
side of the table

what can you expect of fools liked etc hard and de gaute ti wish id
been there

and the duke interferes

well said rupert meditatively thats hardly a fairway of putting
it perhaps i want to interfere

and she prefers the duke

ay the silly creature ah well you think about my plan and with a
bow he pricked his horse and trotted after the body of his friend

i went back to flavia and sapt pondering on the strangeness of the man
wicked men i have known in plenty but rupert hentz au remains unique in
my experience and if there be another anywhere let him be caught and
hanged out of hand so say i

hes very handsome is n the said flavia

well of course she didnt know him as i did yeti was put out for i
though this bold glances would have made her angry but my dear flavia
was a woman and so she was not put out on the contrary she thought
young rupert very handsome as beyond question the ruffian was

and how sad he looked a this friends death said she

hell have better reason to be sad a this own observed sapt with a
grim smile

as for me i grew sulky unreasonable it was perhaps for what better
business had i to look at her with love than had even rupert s lustful
eyes and sulky i remained till as evening fell and we rode up to
t arlen he ims apt having fallen behind in case anyone should be
following us flavia riding close beside me said softly with a little
half ashamed laugh

unless you smile rudolf i cry why are you angry

it was something that fellow said to me said i but i was smiling as
we reached the door and dismounted

there a servant handed me a note it was unaddressed

is it for me i asked

yes sire a boy brought it

i to re it open


johann carries this for me i warned you once in the name of god and
if you area man rescue me from this den of murderers adem


i handed it to sapt but all that the tough old soul said in reply to
this piteous appeal was

whose fault brought her there

nevertheless not being faultless myself i took leave to pity
antoinette dem au ban




chapter

a desperate plan


as i had ridden publicly in zenda and had talked there with rupert
hentz au of course all pretence of illness was at an end i marked the
effect on the garrison of zenda they ceased to be seen abroad and any
of my men who went near the castle reported that the utmost vigilance
prevailed there touched as i was by madame dem au bans appeal i seemed
as powerless to be friend her as i had proved to help the king michael
bade me defiance and although he too had been seen outside the walls
with more disregard for appearances than he had hitherto shown he did
not take the trouble to send any excuse for his failure to wait on the
king time ran on in in activity when every moment was pressing for
not only was i faced with the new danger which the stir about my
disappearance broughton me but great murmurs had arisen instr elsa u at
my continued absence from the city they had been greater but for the
knowledge that flavia was with me and for this reason i suffered her to
stay though i hated to have her where danger was and though every
day of our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost to
breaking as a final blow nothing would content my advisers strake nc z
and the chancellor who came out from st rels automake an urgent
representation to me save that i should appoint a day for the public
solemnization of my betrothal a ceremony which in ruritan i a is well
nigh as binding and great a thing as the marriage itself and this with
flavia sitting by me i was forced to do setting a date a fortnight
ahead and appointing the cathedral instr elsa u as the place and this
formal act being published far and wide caused great joy throughout the
kingdom and was the talk of all tongues so that i reckoned there were
butt women who chafed at i time an black michael and myself and but
one who did not know of it that one the man whose name i bore the king
of ruritan i a

in truth i heard something of the way the news was received in the
castle for after an interval of three days the man johann greedy for
more money though fearful for his life again found means to visit us
he had been waiting on the duke when the tidings came black michaels
face had grown blacker still and he had sworn savagely nor was he
better pleased when young rupert took oath that i meant to do as i
said and turning to madame dem au ban wished her joy on a rival gone
michaels hand stole towards his sword said johann but not abit did
rupert care for her allied the duke on having made a better king than
had reigned for years past in ruritan i a and said he with a meaning
bow to his exasperated master the devils ends the princess a finer man
than heaven had marked out for her by my soul it does then michael
harshly bade him hold his tongue and leave them but rupert must needs
first kiss madame sh and which he did as though he loved her while
michael glared at him

this was the lighter side of the fellows news but more serious came
behind and it was plain that if time pressed att arlen heim it pressed
nonetheless fiercely at zenda for the king was very sick johann had
seen him and he was wasted and hardly able to move there could be no
thought of taking another for him now so alarmed were they that they
had sent for a physician from str elsa u and the physician having been
introduced into the kings cell had come forth pale and trembling and
urgently prayed the duke to let him go back and meddle no more in the
affair but the duke would not and held him there a prisoner telling
him his life was safe if the king lived while the duke desired and died
when the duke desired not otherwise and persuaded by the physician
they had allowed madame dem au ban to visit the king and give him such
attendance as his state needed and as only a woman can give yet his
life hung in the balance and i was still strong and whole and free
wherefore great gloom reigned at zenda and save when they quarrelled
to which they were very prone they hardly spoke but the deeper the
depression of the rest young rupert went about satans work with a
smile in his eye and a song on his lip and laughed fit to burst said
johann because the duke always set d etc hard to guard the king when
madame dem au ban was in the cell which precaution was indeed not
unwise in my careful brother thus johann told his tale and seized his
crowns ye the besought us to allow him to stay with us int arlen heim
and not venture his head again in the lions den but we had need of him
there and although i refused to constrain him i prevailed on him by
increased rewards to go back and carry tidings to madame dem au ban that
i was working for her and that if she could she should speak one
word of comfort to the king for while suspense is bad for the sick yet
despair is worse still and it might be that the king lay dying of mere
hopelessness for i could learn of no definite disease that afflicted
him

and how do they guard the king now i asked remembering that two of
the six were dead and max hol f also

d etc hard and berson in watch by night rupert hentz au and de gaute t by
day sir he answered

only two at a time

ay sir but the others rest in a room just above and are within sound
of a cryor a whistle

a room just above i didnt know of that is there any communication
between it and the room where they watch

no sir you must go down a few stairs and through the door by the
drawbridge and so to where the king is lodged

and that door is locked

only the four lords have keys sir

i drew nearer to him

and have they keys of the grating i asked in a low whisper

i think sir only d etc hard and rupert

where does the duke lodge

in the chateau on the first floor his apartments are on the right as
you go towards the drawbridge

and madame dem au ban

just opposite on the left but her door is locked after she has
entered

to keep her in

doubtless sir

perhaps for another reason

it is possible

and the duke i suppose has the key

yes and the drawbridge is drawn back at night and of that too the
duke holds the key so that it can not be run across the moat without
application to him

and where do you sleep

in the entrance hall of the chateau with five servants

armed

they have pikes sir but no firearms the duke will not trust them
with firearms

then at last i took the matter boldly in my hands i had failed once at
jacobs ladder i should fail again there i must make the attack from
the other side

i have promised you twenty thousand crowns said i you shall have
fifty thousand if you will do what i ask of you tomorrow night but
first do those servants know who your prisoner is

no sir they believe him to be some private enemy of the dukes

and they would not doubt that i am the king

how should they he asked

look to this then tomorrow at two in the morning exactly fling open
the frontdoor of the chateau dont fail by an instant

shall you be there sir

ask no questions do what i tell you say the hall is close or what
you will that is all i ask of you

and may i escape by the door sir when i have opened it

yes as quick as your legs will carry you one thing more carry this
note to madame oh its in french you cant read it and charge her
for the sake of all our lives not to fail in what it orders

the man was trembling but i had to trust to what he had of courage and
to what he had of honesty i dared not wait for i feared that the king
would die

when the fellow was gone i called sapt and fritz to me and unfolded
the plan that i had formed sapt shook his head over it

why cant you wai the asked

the king may die

michael will be forced to act before that

then said i the king may live

well and if he does

for a fortnight i asked simply

and sap tbi this moustache

suddenly fritz vont arlen heim laid his hand on my shoulder

let us go and make the attempt said he

i mean you to go dont be afraid said i

ay but do you stay here and take care of the princess

a gleam came into olds apts eye

we should have michael one way or the other then he chuckled
whereas if you go and are killed with the king what will become of
those of us who are left

they will serve queen flavia said i and i would to god i could be
one of them

a pause followed olds apt broke it by saying sadly yet with an un meant
drollery that set fritz and me laughing

why didnt old rudolf the third marry your great grandmother was it

come said i it is the king we are thinking about

it is true said fritz

moreover i went on i have been an impostor for the profit of
another but i will not be one for my own and if the king is not alive
and on his throne before the day of betrothal comes i will tell the
truth come what may

you shall go lads aids apt

here is the plan i had made a strong party under s apts command was
to steal up to the door of the chateau if discovered prematurely they
were to kill anyone who found them with their swords for i wanted no
noise of firing if all went well they would beat the door when johann
opened it they were to rush in and secure the servants if their mere
presence and the use of the kings name were not enough at the same
moment and on this hinged the plan a womans cry was to ring outloud
and shrill from antoinette dem au bans chamber again and again she was
to cry helphelp michael help and then to utter the name of young
rupert hentz authen as we hoped michael in fury would rush out of
his apartments opposite and fall alive into the hands of sapt still
the cries would go on and my men would letdown the drawbridge and it
would best range if rupert hearing his name thus taken in vain did not
descend from where he slept and seek to cross de gaute t might or might
not come with him that must be left to chance

and when rupert set his foot on the drawbridge there was my part for i
was minded for another swim in the moat and lest i should grow weary
i had resolved to take with me a small wooden ladder on which i could
rest my arms in the water and my feet when i left it i would rear it
against the wall just by the bridge and when the bridge was across i
would stealthily creep on to it and then if rupert or de gaute t crossed
in safety it would be my misfortune not my fault they dead t women
only would remain and for them we must trust to the confusion we had
created and to a sudden rush we should have the keys of the door that
led to the all important rooms perhaps they would rush out if they
stood by their orders then the kings life hung on the swiftness with
which we could force the outer door and i thanked god that not rupert
hentz au watched but d etc hard for though d etc hard was a coolman
relentless and no coward he had neither the dash nor the recklessness
of rupert moreover he if anyone of them really loved black michael
and it might be that he would leave berson into guard the king and rush
across the bridge to take part in the affray on the other side

so i planned desperately and that our enemy might be the better
lulled to security i gave orders that our residence should be
brilliantly lighted from top to bottom as though we were engaged in
revelry and should so be kept all night with music playing and people
moving to and frost rake nc z would be there and he was to conceal our
departure if he could from flavia and if we came not again by the
morning he was to march openly and in force to the castle and demand
the person of the king if black michael were not there as i did not
think he would be the marshal would take flavia with him as swiftly as
he could to str elsa u and there proclaim black michaels treachery and
the probable death of the king and rally all that there was honest and
true round the banner of the princess and to say truth this was what
i thought most likely to happen for i had great doubts whether either
the king or black michael or i had more than a day to live well if
black michael died and if i the play actor slew rupert hentz au with
my own hand and then died myself it might be that fate would deal
a slightly with ruritan i a as could be hoped notwithstanding that she
demanded the life of the king and to her dealing thus with me i was in
no temper to make objection

it was late when we rose from conference and i be took me to the
princess s apartments she was pensive that evening yet when i left
her she flung her arms about me and grew for an instant bashfully
radiant as she slipped a ring on my finger i was wearing the kings
ring but i had also on my little finger a plain band of gold engraved
with the motto of our family nil quae feci this i took off and put
on her and signed to her to let me go and she understanding stood
away and watched me with dimmed eyes

wear that ring eventhough you wear another when you are queen i
said

whatever else i wear this i will wear till i die and after said she
as she kissed the ring




chapter

young rupert s midnight diversions


the night came fine and clear i had prayed for dirty weather such as
had favoured my previous voyage in the moat but fortune was this time
against me still i reckoned that by keeping close under the wall and in
the shadow i could escape detection from the windows of the chateau
that looked out on the scene of my efforts if they searched the moat
indeed my scheme must fail but i did not think they would they had
made jacobs ladder secure against attack johann had himself helped
to fix it closely to the masonry on the underside so that it could
not now be moved from below anymore than from above an assault with
explosives or along battering with picks alone could displace it and
the noise involved in either of these operations put them out of the
question what harm then could amando in the moat i trusted that
black michael putting this query to himself would answer confidently
none while even if johann meant treachery he did not know my
scheme and would doubtless expect to see meat the head of my friends
before the front entrance to the chateau there i said to sapt was the
real danger and there i added you shall be doesnt that content
you

but it did not dearly would he have liked to come with me had i not
utterly refused to take him one man might escape notice to double
the party more than doubled the risk and when he ventured to hint once
again that my life was too valuable i knowing the secret though the
clung to sternly bade him be silent assuring him that unless the king
lived through the night i would not live through it either

at twelve o clocks apts command left the chateau of t arlen heim and
struck off to the right riding by un frequented roads and avoiding the
town of zenda if all went well they would be in front of the castle by
about a quarter to two leaving their horses half a mile off they were
to steal up to the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the
opening of the door if the door were not opened by two they were to
send fritz vont arlen heim round to the other side of the castle i would
meet him there if i were alive and we would consult whether to storm
the castle or not if i were not there they were to return with all
speed to t arlen heim rouse the marshal and march in force to zenda for
if not there i should be dead and i knew that the king would not be
alive five minutes after i ceased to breathe i must now leaves apt and
his friends and relate how i myself proceeded on this eventful night
i went out on the good horse which had carried me on the night of
the coronation back from the hunting lodge to str elsa ui carried a
revolver in the saddle and my sword i was covered with a large cloak
and under this i wore a warm tight fitting woollen jersey a pair of
knickerbockers thick stockings and light canvas shoes i had rubbed
myself thoroughly with oil and i carried a large flask of whisky the
night was warm but i might probably be immersed along while and it
was necessary to take every precaution against cold for cold not only
sapsa mans courage if he has to die but impairs his energy if others
have to die and finally gives him rheumatic s if it be gods will
that he lives also i tied round my body a length of thin but stout
cord and i did not forget my ladder i starting after sapt took a
shorter route skirting the town to the left and found myself in the
outskirts of the forest at about half past twelve i tied my horse up
in a thick clump of trees leaving the revolver in its pocket in the
saddle it would be no use to me and ladder in handmade my way to
the edge of the moa there i unwound my rope from about my waist bound
it securely round the trunk of a tree on the bank and let myself down
the castle clocks truck a quarter to one as i felt the water under me
and began to swim round the keep pushing the ladder before me and
hugging the castle wall thus voyaging i came to my old friend
jacobs ladder and felt the ledge of the masonry under me i crouched
down in the shadow of the great pipe i tried to stir it but it was
quite immovable and waited i remember that my predominant feeling
was neither anxiety for the king nor longing for flavia but an intense
desire to smoke and this craving of course i could not gratify

the drawbridge was still in its place i saw its airy slight framework
above me some ten yards to my right as i crouched with my back against
the wall of the kings cell i made out a window two yards my side of it
and nearly on the same level that if johann spoke true must belong to
the dukes apartments and on the other side in about the same relative
position must be madame dem au bans window women are careless
forgetful creatures i prayed that she might not forget that she was to
be the victim of a brutal attempt at two oclock precisely i was rather
amused at the part i had assigned to my young friend rupert hentz au but
i owed him a stroke for even as is at my shoulder ached where he had
with an audacity that seemed half to hide his treachery struck at me
in the sight of all my friends on the terrace att arlen heim

suddenly the dukes window grew bright the shutters were not closed
and the interior became partially visible to me as i cautiously raised
myself till i stood on tiptoe thus placed my range of sight embraced a
yard or more inside the window while the radius of light did not
reach me the window was flung open and someone looked out i marked
antoinette dem au bans graceful figure and though her face was in
shadow the fine outline of her head was revealed against the light
behind i longed to cry softly remember but i dared not and
happily for a moment later a man came up and stood by her he tried to
put his arm round her waist but with a swift motion she sprang away and
leant against the shutter her profile towards me i made out who the
newcomer was it was young rupert a low laugh from him made mesure as
he leant forward stretching out his hand towards her

gently gently i murmured you re too soon my boy

his head was close to her si suppose he whispered to her for i saw her
point to the moat and i heard her say in slow and distinct tones

i had rather throw myself out of this window

he came closeup to the window and looked out

it looks cold said he come antoinette are you serious

she made no answers of ar as i heard and he smiting his hand petulantly
on the windowsill went on in the voice of some spoilt child

hang black michael isnt the princess enough for him is he to have
everything what the devil do you see in black michael

if it old him what you says he began

well tell him said rupert carelessly and catching her off her
guard he sprang forward and kissed her laughing and crying theres
something to tell him

if i had kept my revolver with me i should have been very sorely
tempted being spared the temptation i merely added this new score to
his account

though faith said rupert its little he care she smad about the
princess you know he talks of nothing but cutting the play actors
throat

didn the indeed

and if i do it for him what do you think hes promised me

the unhappy woman raised her hands above her head in prayer or in
despair

but ide test waiting said rupert and i saw that he was about to
lay his hand on her again when there was a noise of a door in the room
opening and a harsh voice cried

what are you doing here sir

rupert turned his back to the window bowed low and said in his loud
merry tones apologizing for your absence sir could i leave the lady
alone

the newcomer must be black michael i saw him directly a she advanced
towards the window he caught young rupert by the arm

the moat would hold more than the king said he with a significant
gesture

does your highness threaten me asked rupert

a threat is more warning than most men get from me

yet observed rupert rudolf ras send yll has been much threatened and
yet lives

am i in fault because my servants bungle asked michael scornfully

your highness has run no risk of bungling sneered rupert

it was telling the duke that he shirked danger as plain as ever i
have heard a man told black michael had self control i daresay he
scowled it was a great regret to me that i could not see their faces
better but his voice was even and calm a she answered

enough enough we must nt quarrel rupert a red etc hard and berson in
at their posts

they are sir

i need you no more

nay im not oppressed with fatigue said rupert

pray sir leave us said michael more impatiently in ten minutes
the drawbridge will be drawn back and i presume you have no wish to
swim to your bed

rupert s figure disappeared i heard the door open and shut again
michael and antoinette dem au ban were left together to my chagrin
the duke laid his hand on the window and closed i the stood talking
to antoinette for a moment or two she shook her head and he turned
impatiently away she left the window the door sounded again and black
michael closed the shutters

de gaute t de gaute t man sounded from the drawbridge unless you
want a bath before your bed come along

it was rupert s voice coming from the end of the drawbridge a moment
later he and de gaute t stepped out on the bridge rupert sarm was
through de gaute ts and in the middle of the bridge he detained his
companion and leant over i dropped behind the shelter of jacobs
ladder

then master rupert had a little sport he took from de gaute ta bottle
which he carried and put it to his lips

hardly a drop he cried dis contentedly and flung it in the moat

it fellas i judged from the sound and the circles on the water within
a yard of the pipe and rupert taking out his revolver began to shoot
at it the first two shots missed the bottle but hit the pipe the
third shattered the bottle i hoped that the young ruffian would be
content but he emptied the other barrels at the pipe and one skimming
over the pipe whistled through my hair as i crouched on the other side

ware bridge a voice cried to my relief

rupert and de gaute t cried a moment and ran across the bridge was
drawn back and all became still the clocks truck a quarter past one i
rose and stretched myself and yawned

i think some ten minutes had passed when i heard as light noise to my
right i peered over the pipe and saw a dark figure standing in the
gateway that led to the bridge it was a man by the careless graceful
poise i guessed it to be rupert again he held as word in his hand and
he stood motionless for a minute or two wild thoughts ran through me
on what mischief was the young fiend bent now then he laughed low
to himself then he turned his face to the wall took a step in my
direction and to my surprise began to climbdown the wall in an
instant i saw that there must be steps in the wall it was plain they
were cut into or affixed to the wall at intervals of about eighteen
inches rupert set his foot on the lower one then he placed his sword
between his teeth turned round and noiselessly let himself into the
water had it been a matter of my life only i would have swum to
meet him dearly would i have loved to fight it out with him then and
there with steel on a fine night and none to come between us but
there was the king i restrained myself but i could not bridle my swift
breathing and i watched him with the intense st eagerness

he swam leisurely and quietly across there were more steps upon
the other side and he climbed them when he set foot in the gateway
standing on the drawn back bridge he felt in his pocket and took
something out i heard him unlock the door i could hear no noise of its
closing behind him he vanished from my sight

abandoning my ladder is a wi did not need it now i swam to the side of
the bridge and climbed halfway up the steps there i hung with my sword
in my hand listening eagerly the dukes room was shuttered and dark
there was a light in the window on the opposite side of the bridge
not a sound broke the silence till half past one chimed from the great
clock in the tower of the chateau

there were other plots than mine a foot in the castle that night




chapter

the forcing of the trap


the position where in i stood does not appear very favourable to thought
yet for the next moment or two i thought profoundly i had it old
myself scored one point be rupert hentz a user r and what it might and
the villainy he was engaged on what it would i had scored one point he
was on the other side of the moat from the king and it would be by no
fault of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again i had three
left to deal with two on guard and de gaute tin his bed a hifi
had the keys i would have risked everything and attacked d etc hard and
berson in before their friends could join them but i was powerless i
must wait till the coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the
bridge someone with the keys and i waited as it seemed for half an
hour really for about five minutes before the next act in the rapid
drama began

all was still on the other side the dukes room remained inscrutable
behind its shutters the light burnt steadily in madame dem au bans
window then i heard the faintest faintest sound it came from behind
the door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat it
but just reached m year yeti could not be mistaken as to what it was
it was made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly who was
turning it and of what room was it the key there leapt before my eyes
the picture of young rupert with the key in one hand his sword in the
other and an evil smile on his face but i did not know what door it
was nor on which of his favourite pursuits young rupert was spending
the hours of that night

i was soon to be enlightened for the next moment before my friends
could be near the chateau door before johann the keeper would have
thought to nerve himself for his task there was a sudden crash from
the room with the lighted window it sounded as though someone had flung
down a lamp and the window went dark and black at the same instant a
cry rang out shrill in the night helphelp michael help and was
followed by a shriek of utter terror

i was tingling in every nerve i stood on the top most step clinging to
the threshold of the gate with my righthand and holding my sword in my
left suddenly i perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge
there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand i
darted across and stood there thus placed i commanded the path and no
man could pass between the chateau and the oldcastle till he had tried
conclusions with me

there was another shriek then a door was flung open and clanged against
the wall and i heard the handle of a door savagely twisted

open the door in gods name whats the matter cried a voice the
voice of black michael himself

he was answered by the very words i had written in my letter

help michael hentz au

a fierce oath rang out from the duke and with aloud thud he threw
himself against the door at the same moment i heard a window above my
head open and a voice cried whats the matter and i heard a mans
hasty footsteps i grasped my sword if de gaute t came my way the six
would be less by one more

then i heard the clash of crossed swords and at ramp of feet and i
can not tell the thing so quickly as it happened for all seemed to come
at once there was an angry cry from madame s room the cry of a wounded
man the window was flung open young rupert stood there sword in hand
he turned his back and i saw his body go forward to the lunge

ah johann theres one for you come on michael

johann was there then come to the rescue of the duke how would he
open the door for me for i feared that rupert had slain him

help cried the dukes voice faint and husky

i heard a step on the stairs above me and i heard a stir down to my
left in the direction of the kings cell but before anything happened
on my side of the moat i saw five or six men round young rupert in
the embr a sure of madame s window three or four time she lunged with
incomparable dash and dexterity for an instant they fell back leaving
arin ground him he leapt on the parapet of the window laughing a she
leapt and waving his sword in his hand he was drunk with blood and he
laughed again wildly a she flung himself headlong into the moat

what became of him then i did not see for a she leapt de gaute ts
lean face looked out through the door by me and without a seconds
hesitation is truck at him with all the strength god had given me and
he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan i dropped on my
knees by him where were the keys i found myself muttering the keys
man the keys as though he had been yet alive and could listen and
when i could not find them i god forgive me i believe is truck a
deadman s face

at last i had them there were but three seizing the largest i felt
the lock of the door that led to the cell i fitted in the key it was
right the lock turned i drew the door close behind me and locked it as
noiselessly as i could putting the key in my pocket

i found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs an oil lamp
burnt dimly in the bracket i took it down and held it in my hand and i
stood and listened

what in the devil can it be i heard a voice say

it came from behind a door that faced meat the bottom of the stairs

and another answered

shall we kill him

is trained to hear the answer and could have sobbed with relief when
d etc hard s voice came grating and cold

wait abit there ll be trouble if we strike too soon

there was a moments silence then i heard the bolt of the door
cautiously drawn back instantly i put out the light i held replacing
the lamp in the bracket

its dark the lamps out have you a light said the other
voice berson ins

no doubt they had a light but they should not use it it was come to
the crisis now and i rushed down the steps and flung myself against the
door berson in had unbolted it and it gave way before me the belgian
stood there sword in hand and d etc hard was sitting on a couch at the
side of the room in astonishment at seeing me berson in recoiled
d etc hard jumped to his sword i rushed madly at the belgian he gave
way before me and i drove him up against the wall he was no swordsman
though he fought bravely and in a moment he lay on the floor before
me i turned d etc hard was not there faithful to his order she had
not risked a fight with me but had rushed straight to the door of the
kings room opened it and slammed it behind him even now he was a this
work inside

and surely he would have killed the king and perhaps me also had it
not been for one devoted man who gave his life for the king for when i
forced the door the sight i saw was this the king stood in the corner
of the room broken by his sickness he could do nothing his fettered
hands moved uselessly up and down and he was laughing horribly in
half mad delirium d etc hard and the doctor were together in the middle
of the room and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer pinning
his hands to his sides for an instant the nd etc hard wrenched himself
free from the feeble grip and as i entered drove his sword through
the hapless man then he turned on me crying

at last

we were sword to sword by blessed chance neither he nor berson in had
been wearing their revolvers i found them afterwards ready loaded
on the mantelpiece of the outer room it was hard by the door ready to
their hands but my sudden rush in had cutoff access to them yes we
were man to man and we began to fight silently sternly and hard
yeti remember little of it save that the man was my match with the
sword nay and more for he knew more tricks than i and that he forced
me back against the bars that guarded the entrance to jacobs ladder
and is a was mile on his face and he wounded me in the left arm

no glory do i take for that contest i believe that the man would have
mastered me and slain me and then done his butchers work for he was
the most skilful swordsman i have ever met but even a she pressed me
hard the half mad wasted wan creature in the corner leapt high in
lunatic mirth shrieking

its cousin rudolf cousin rudolf ill help you cousin rudolf and
catching up a chair in his hands he could but just lift it from the
ground and hold it uselessly before him he came towards us hope came
to me come on i cried come on drive it against his legs

d etc hard replied with a savage thrust he all but had me

come on come on man i cried come and share the fun

and the king laughed gleefully and came on pushing his chair before
him

with an oath d etc hard skipped back and before i knew what he was
doing had turned his sword against the king he made one fierce cut at
the king and the king with a piteous cry dropped where he stood the
stout ruffian turned to face me again but his own hand had prepared
his destruction for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed
from the dead physician he slipped he fell like a dart i was upon
him i caught him by the throat and before he could recover himself i
drove my point through his neck and with a stifled curse he fell across
the body of his victim

was the king dead it was my first thought i rushed to where he lay
ay it seemed as if he were dead for he had a great gash across his
forehead and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor i dropped on
my knees beside him and lean tm year down to hear if he breathed but
before i could there was aloud rattle from the outside i knew the
sound the drawbridge was being pushed out a moment later it rang home
against the wall on my side of the moat i should be caught in a trap
and the king with me if he yet lived he must take his chance to
live or die i took my sword and passed into the outer room who were
pushing the drawbridge out my men if so all was well my eye fell on
the revolvers and i seized one and paused to listen in the doorway of
the outer room to listen say i yes and to get my breath and i to re
my shirt and twisted a strip of it round my bleeding armand stood
listening again i would have given the world to hears apts voice for
i was faint spent and weary and that wildcat rupert hentz au was yet
at large in the castle yet because i could better defend the narrow
door at the top of the stairs than the wider entrance to the room i
dragged myself up the steps and stood behind it listening

what was the sound again a strange one for the place and time an
easy scornful merry laugh the laugh of young rupert hentz au i could
scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh yet the laugh told me that
my men had not come for they must have shot rupert ere now if they had
come and the clocks truck half past two my god the door had not been
opened they had gone to the bank they had notfound me they had gone
by now back to t arlen heim with the news of the kings death and mine
well it would be true before they got there was not rupert laughing in
triumph

for a moment i sank unnerved against the door then i started up
alert again for rupert cried scornfully

well the bridge is there come over it and in gods name lets see
black michael keep back you curs michael come and fight for her

if it were a three cornered fight i might yet be army part i turned
the key in the door and looked out




chapter

face to face in the forest


for a moment i could see nothing for the glare of lanterns and torches
caught me full in the eyes from the other side of the bridge but soon
the scene grew clear and it was a strange scene the bridge was in its
place at the far end of it stood a group of the dukes servants two or
three carried the lights which had dazzled me three or four held pikes
in rest they were huddled together their weapons were protruded before
them their faces were pale and agitated to put it plainly they
looked in as arrant a fright as i have seen men look and they gazed
apprehensively ataman who stood in the middle of the bridges word in
hand rupert hentz au was in his trousers and shirt the white linen
was stained with blood but his easy buoyant pose told me that he was
himself either not touched at all or merely scratched there he stood
holding the bridge against them and daring them to come on or rather
bidding them send black michael to him and they having no firearms
cowered before the desperate man and dared not attack him they
whispered to one another and in the back most rank i saw my friend
johann leaning against the portal of the door and stan ching with a
handkerchief the blood which flowed from a wound in his cheek

by marvellous chance i was master the cravens would oppose me no more
than they dared attack rupert i had but to raise my revolver and i
sent him to his account with his sins on his head he did not so much as
know that i was there i did nothing why i hardly know to this day
i had killed one man stealthily that night and another by luck rather
than skill perhaps it was that again villain as the man was i did
not relish being one of a crowd against him perhaps it was that but
stronger than either of these restrained feelings came a curiosity and
a fascination which held me spellbound watching for the outcome of the
scene

michael you dog michael if you can stand come on cried rupert
and he advanced a step the group shrinking back a little before him
michael you bastard come on

the answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman

hes dead my god hes dead

dead shouted rupert is truck better than i knew and he laughed
triumphantly then he went on down with your weapons there im your
master now down with them i say

i believe they would have obeyed but a she spoke came new things
first there arose a distant sound as of shouts and knocking s from the
other side of the chateau my heart leapt it must be my men come by a
happy disobedience to seek me the noise continued but none of the
rest seemed to he edit their attention was chained by what now happened
before their eyes the group of servants parted and a woman staggered on
to the bridge antoinette dem au ban was in a loose white robe her dark
hair streamed over her shoulders her face was ghastly pale and her
eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches in her shaking hands he
held a revolver and as she tottered forward she fired it at rupert
hentz au the ball missed him and struck the woodwork over my head

faith madame laughed rupert had your eyes been no more deadly
than your shooting i had not been in this scrape nor black michael in
hell tonight

she took no notice of his words with a wonderful efforts he
calmed herself till she stood still and rigid then very slowly and
deliberately she began to raise her arm again taking most careful aim

he would be mad to risk i the must rush on her chancing the bullet or
retreat towards me i covered him with my weapon

he did neither before she had g other aim he bowed in his most
graceful fashion cried icant kill where ive kissed and before
she or i could stop him laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge and
lightly leapt into the moat

at that very moment i heard a rush of feet and a voice i
k news apts cry god its the duke dead then i knew that the king
needed me no more and throwing down my revolver i sprang out on the
bridge there was a cry of wild wonder the king and then i like
rupert of hentz a us word in hand vaulted over the parapet intent on
finishing my quarrel with him where i saw his curly head fifteen yards
off in the water of the moat

he swam swiftly and easily i was weary and half crippled with my
wounded armi could not gain on him for a time i made no sound but as
we rounded the corner of the old keep i cried

stop rupert stop

i saw him look over his shoulder but he swam on he was under the bank
now searching as i guessed for a spot that he could climb i knew
there to be none but there was my rope which would still be hanging
where i had left i the would come to where it was before i could
perhaps he would miss it perhaps he would find it and if he drew it up
after him he would get a good start of me i put forth all my remaining
strength and pressed on at last i began to gain on him for he
occupied with his search unconsciously slackened hi space

ah he had found it a low shout of triumph came from him he laid
hold of it and began to haul himself up i was near enough to hear him
mutter how the devil comes this here i was at the rope and he
hanging in midair saw me but i could not reach him

hullo whos here he cried in startled tones

for a moment i believe he took me for the king i daresay i was pale
enough to lend colour to the thought but an instant later he cried

why its the play actor how come you here man

and so saying he gained the bank

i laid hold of the rope but i paused he stood on the banks word in
hand and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as i
came up i let go the rope

nevermind said i but asia m here i think ill stay

he smiled down on me

these women are the deuce he began when suddenly the great bell of
the castle started to ring furiously and aloud shout reached us from
the moat

rupert smiled again and waved his hand to me

i should like a turn with you but its a little too hot said he and
he disappeared from above me

in an instant without thinking of danger i laid my hand to the rope
i was up i saw him thirty yards off running like a deer towards the
shelter of the forest for once rupert hentz au had chosen discretion for
his part i laid my feet to the ground and rushed after him calling to
him to stand he would not un wounded and vigorous he gained on meat
every step but forgetting everything in the world except him and my
thirst for his blood i pressed on and soon the deep shades of the
forest of zenda engulfed us both pursued and pursuer

it was three oclock now and day was dawning i was on along straight
grass avenue and a hundred yards ahead ran young rupert his curls
waving in the fresh breeze i was weary and panting he looked over his
shoulder and waved his hand again to me he was mocking me for he saw
he had the pace of me i was forced to pause for breath a moment later
rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight

i thought all was over and in deep vexation sank on the ground but i
was up again directly for as cream rang through the forest a womans
scream putting forth the last of my strength iran on to the place
where he had turned out of my sight and turning also i saw him again
but alas i could not touch him he was in the act of lifting a girl
down from her horse doubtless it washers cream that i heard she
looked like a small farmers or a peasants daughter and she carried
a basket on her arm probably she was on her way to the early market at
zenda her horse was a stout well shaped animal master rupert lifted
her down amid her shrieks the sight of him frightened her but he
treated her gently laughed kissed her and gave her money then he
jumped on the horse sitting sideways like a woman and then he waited
for me i on my part waited for him

presently hero de towards me keeping his distance however he lifted
up his hand saying

what did you in the castle

i killed three of your friends said i

what you got to the cells

yes

and the king

he was hurt by d etc hard before i killed d etc hard but i pray that he
lives

you fool said rupert pleasantly

one thing more i did

and whats that

i spared your life i was behind you on the bridge with a revolver in
my hand

no faith i was between two fires

get off your horse i cried and fight like a man

before a lady said he pointing to the girl fie your majesty

then in my rage hardly knowing what i did i rushed at him for a
moment he seemed to waver then herein ed his horse in and stood waiting
for me on i went in my folly i seized the bridle and is truck at him
he parried and thrust at me i fell back a pace and rushed at him again
and this time i reached his face and laid his cheek open and darted
back almost before he could strike me he seemed almost dazed at the
fierceness of my attack otherwise i think he must have killed me i
sank on my knee panting expecting him to ride at me and so he would
have done and then and there i doubt not one or both of us would have
died but at the moment there came a shout from behind us and looking
round i saw just at the turn of the avenue a man on a horse he was
riding hard and he carried a revolver in his hand it was fritz von
t arlen heim my faithful friend rupert saw him and knew that the game
was up he checked his rush at me and flung his leg over the saddle but
yet for just a moment he waited leaning forward he tossed his hair off
his forehead and smiled and said au revoir rudolf ras send yll

then with his cheek streaming blood but his lips laughing and his
body swaying with ease and grace he bowed to me and he bowed to the
farmgirl who had drawn near in trembling fascination and he waved his
hand to fritz who was just within range and let fly a shot at him the
ball came nigh doing its work for it struck the sword he held and he
dropped the sword with an oath wringing his fingers and clapped his
heels hard on his horses belly and rode away at a gallop

and i watched him go down the long avenue riding as though hero de for
his pleasure and singing a she went for all there was that gash in his
cheek

once again he turned to wave his hand and then the gloom of thickets
swallowed him and he was lost from our sight thus he vanished reckless
and wary graceful and graceless handsome debonair vile and
unconquered and if lung my sword passionately on the ground and cried
to fritz to ride after him but fritz stopped his horse and leapt down
and ran to me and knelt putting his arm about me and indeed it was
time for the wound that d etc hard had given me was broken forth a fresh
and my blood was staining the ground

then give me the horse i cried staggering to my feet and throwing
his arms off me and the strength of my rage carried me so far as where
the horse stood and then i fell prone beside it and fritz knelt by me
again

fritz i said

ay friend dear friend he said tender as a woman

is the king alive

he took his handkerchief and wiped my lips and bent and kissed me on
the forehead

thanks to the most gallant gentleman that lives said he softly the
king is alive

the little farmgirl stood by us weeping for fright and wide eyed for
wonder for she had seen meat zenda and was not i pallid dripping
foul and bloody as i was yet was not i the king

and when i heard that the king was alive is trove to cry hurrah but
i could not speak and i laid my head back in fritz s arms and closed
my eyes and i groaned and then lest fritz should dome wrong in his
thoughts i opened my eyes and tried to say hurrah again but i could
not and being very tired and now very cold i huddled myself closeup
to fritz to get the warmth of him and shut my eyes again and went to
sleep




chapter

the prisoner and the king


in order to a full understanding of what had occurred in the castle of
zenda it is necessary to supplement my account of what i myself saw
and did on that night by relating briefly what i afterwards learnt
from fritz and madame dem au ban the story told by the latter explained
clearly how it happened that the cry which i had arranged as a stratagem
and as ham had come in dreadful reality before its time and had thus
as it seemed at the moment ruined our hopes while in the end it
had favoured them the unhappy woman fired i believe by a genuine
attachment to the duke of str elsa uno less than by the dazzling
prospects which a dominion over him opened before here yes had followed
him a this request from paris to ruritan i a he was a man of strong
passions but of stronger will and his cool head ruled both he was
content to take all and give nothing when she arrived she was not
long in finding that she had a rival in the princess flavia rendered
desperate she stood at nothing which might give or keep for her her
power over the duke as i say he took and gave not simultaneously
antoinette found herself entangled in his audacious schemes unwilling
to abandon him bound to him by the chains of shame and hope yet she
would not be a decoy nora this bidding lure me to death hence the
letters of warning she had written whether the lines she sent to flavia
were inspired by good or bad feeling by jealousy or by pity i do not
know but here also she served us well when the duke went to zenda she
accompanied him and here for the first time she learnt the full measure
of his cruelty and was touched with compassion for the unfortunate
king from this time she was with us yet from what she told me i know
that she still as women will loved michael and trusted to gain
his life if no this pardon from the king as the reward for her
assistance his triumph she did not desire for she loathed his crime
and loathed yet more fiercely what would be the prize of i this
marriage with his cousin princess flavia

at zenda new forces came into play the lust and daring of young rupert
he was caught by her beauty perhaps perhaps it was enough for him that
she belonged to another man and that she hated him for many days there
had been quarrels and ill will between him and the duke and the scene
which i had witnessed in the dukes room was but one of many rupert s
proposals to me of which she had of course been ignorant in no
way surprised her when i related them she had herself warned michael
against rupert even when she was calling on me to deliver her from both
of the month is night then rupert had determined to have his will
when she had gone to her room he having furnished himself with a key
to it had made his entrance her cries had brought the duke and there
in the darkroom while she screamed the men had fought and rupert
having wounded his master with a mortal blow had on the servants
rushing in escaped through the window as i have described the dukes
blood spurting out had stained his opponents shirt but rupert not
knowing that he had dealt michael his death was eager to finish the
encounter how he meant to deal with the other three of the band i know
not i daresay he did not think for the killing of michael was not
premeditated antoinette left alone with the duke had tried to stanch
his wound and thus was she busied till he died and then hearing
rupert s taunts she had come forth to avenge him me she had not seen
nor did she till i darted out of my ambush and leapt after rupert into
the moat

the same moment found my friends on the scene they had reached the
chateau in due time and waited ready by the door but johann swept
with the rest to the rescue of the duke did not open it nay he took
apart against rupert putting himself forward more bravely than any
in his anxiety to avert suspicion and he had received a wound in the
embr a sure of the window till nearly half past two sapt waited then
following my order she had sent fritz to search the banks of the moat
i was not there hastening back fritz told sapt and sapt was for
following orders still and riding at full speed back to t arlen heim
while fritz would not hear of abandoning me let me have ordered what i
would on this they disputed some few minutes then sapt persuaded by
fritz detached a party under berne n stein to gallop back to t arlen heim
and bring up the marshal while the rest fell to on the great door
of the chateau for several minutes it resisted them then just as
antoinette dem au ban fired at rupert of hentz au on the bridge they
broke in eight of them in all and the first door they came to was the
door of michaels room and michael lay dead across the threshold with
as word thrust through his breasts apt cried out a this death as i
had heard and they rushed on the servants but these in fear dropped
their weapons and antoinette flung herself weeping at s apts feet and
all she cried was that i had been at the end of the bridge and leapt
off what of the prisoner asked sapt but she shook her head then
sapt and fritz with the gentlemen behind them crossed the bridge
slowly warily and without noise and fritz stumbled over the body of
de gaute tin the way of the door they felt him and found him dead

then they consulted listening eagerly for any sound from the cells
below but there came none and they were greatly afraid that the kings
guards had killed him and having pushed his body through the great
pipe had escaped the same way themselves yet because i had been seen
here they had still some hope thus indeed fritz in his friendship
told me and going back to michaels body pushing aside antoinette
who prayed by it they found a key to the door which i had locked and
opened the door the staircase was dark and they would not use a torch
at first lest they should be more exposed to fire but soon fritz
cried the door down there is open see there is light so they went
on boldly and found none to oppose them and when they came to the
outer room and saw the belgian berson in lying dead they thanked god
sapt say in gay he has been here then rushing into the kings cell
they found d etc hard lying dead across the dead physician and the king
on his back with his chair by him and fritz cried hes dead and
sapt drove all out of the room except fritz and knelt down by the king
and having learnt more of wounds and the sign of death than i he soon
knew that the king was not dead nor if properly attended would die
and they covered his face and carried him to duke michaels room and
laid him there and antoinette rose from praying by the body of the duke
and went to ba the the kings head and dress his wound still a doctor
came and sapt seeing i had been there and having heard antoinette s
story sent fritz to search the moat and then the forest he dared send
no one else and fritz found my horse and feared the worst then as i
have told he found me guided by the shout with which i had called on
rupert to stop and face me and i think a man has never been more glad
to find his own brother alive than was fritz to come on me so that in
love and anxiety for me he thought nothing of a thing so great as would
have been the death of rupert hentz au yet had fritz killed him i
should have grudge d it

the enterprise of the kings rescue being thus prosperously concluded
it lay on colonels apt to secure secrecy as to the king ever having
been in need of rescue antoinette dem au ban and johann the keeper who
indeed was too much hurt to be wagging his tongue just now were sworn
to reveal nothing and fritz went forth to find not the king but the
unnamed friend of the king who had la in in zenda and flashed for
a moment before the dazed eyes of duke michaels servants on the
drawbridge the metamorphosis had happened and the king wounded almost
to death by the attacks of the gaoler s who guarded his friend had
at last overcome them and rested now wounded but alive in black
michaels own room in the castle there he had been carried his face
covered with a cloak from the cell and thence orders issued that if
his friend were found he should be brought directly and privately to
the king and that meanwhile messengers should ride at full speed to
t arlen heim to tell marshall strake nc z to assure the princess of the
kings safety and to come himself with all speed to greet the king
the princess was enjoined to remain att arlen heim and there await her
cousins coming or his further injunctions thus the king would come
to his own again having wrought brave deeds and escaped almost by a
miracle the treacherous assault of his unnatural brother

this ingenious arrangement of my long headed old friend prospered in
every way save where it encountered a force that often defeats the most
cunning schemes i mean nothing else than the pleasure of a woman for
let her cousin and sovereign send what command he chose or colonel
sapt chose for him and let marshal strake nc z insist a she would the
princess flavia was in no way minded to rest att arlen heim while her
l overlay wounded at zenda and when the marshal with a small suite
rode forth from t arlen heim on the way to zenda the princess s carriage
followed immediately behind and in this order they passed through the
town where the report was already rife that the king going the night
before to remonstrate with his brother in all friendliness for that
he held one of the kings friends in confinement in the castle had been
most traitorous ly setup on that there had been a desperate conflict
that the duke was slain with several of his gentlemen and that the
king wounded a she was had seized and held the castle of zenda all of
which talk made as maybe supposed a mighty excitement and the wires
were set in motion and the tidings came to str elsa u only just after
orders had been sent thither to parade the troops and over a we the
dissatisfied quarters of the town with a display of force

thus the princess flavia came to zenda and as she drove up the hill
with the marshal riding by the wheel and still imploring her to return
in obedience to the kings orders fritz vont arlen heim with the
prisoner of zenda came to the edge of the forest i had revived from
my swoon and walked resting on fritz s armand looking out from the
cover of the trees i saw the princess suddenly understanding from a
glance at my companions face that we must not meet her i sank on my
knees behind a clump of bushes but there was one whom we had forgotten
but who followed us and was not disposed to let slip the chance of
earning a smile and maybe a crown or two and while we lay hidden
the little farmgirl came by us and ran to the princess curtsey ing and
crying

madame the king is herein the bushes may i guide you to him
madame

nonsense child said old strake nc z the king lies wounded in the
castle

yessir hes wounded i know but hes there with count fritz and
not at the castle she persisted

is he in two places or are there two kings asked flavia bewildered
and how should he be there

he pursued a gentleman madame and they fought till count fritz came
and the other gentleman took my fathers horse from me and rode away
but the king is here with count fritz why madame is there another man
in ruritan i a like the king

no my child said flavia softly i was told it afterwards and she
smiled and gave the girl money i will go and see this gentleman and
she rose to a light from the carriage

but at this moments apt came riding from the castle and seeing the
princess made the best of a bad job and cried to her that the king was
well tended and in no danger

in the castle she asked

where else madame said he bowing

but this girl says he is yonder with count fritz

sapt turned his eyes on the child with an incredulous smile

every fine gentleman is a king to such said he

why he sas like the king as one pea to another madame cried the
girl a little shaken but still obstinate

sapt started round the old marshals face asked unspoken questions
flavia s glance was no less eloquent suspicion spread quick

ill ride myself and see this man said sapt hastily

nay ill come myself said the princess

then come alone he whispered

and she obedient to the strange hinting in his face prayed the marshal
and the rest to wait and she and sapt came on foot towards where we
lays apt waving to the farmgirl to keep at a distance and when i saw
them coming is at in as ad heap on the ground and buried my face in my
hands i could not look at her fritz knelt by me laying his hand on my
shoulder

speak low whatever you say i heard sapt whisper as they came up and
the next thing i heard was a low cry half of joy half of fear from
the princess

it is he are you hurt

and she fell on the ground by me and gently pulled my hands away but i
kept my eyes to the ground

it is the king she said pray colonels apt tell me where lay the
wit of the joke you played on me

we answered none of us we three were silent before her regardless of
them she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me then sapt spoke in
a low hoarse whisper

it is not the king dont kiss him hes not the king

she drew back for a moment then with an arm still round my neck she
asked in superb indignation

do i not know my love rudolf my love

it is not the king said olds apt again and a sudden sob broke from
tenderhearted fritz

it was the sob that told her no comedy was a foot

he is the king she cried it is the kings face the kings ring my
ring it is my love

your love madame said olds apt but not the king the king is there
in the castle this gentleman

look at me rudolf look at me she cried taking my face between her
hands why do you let them torment me tell me what it means

then i spoke gazing into here yes

god forgive me madame i said i am not the king

i felt her hands clutch my cheeks she gazed at me as never mans face
was scanned yet and i silent again saw wonder born and doubt grow
and terror spring to life as she looked and very gradually the grasp of
her hands slackened she turned to sapt to fritz and back to me then
suddenly she reeled forward and fell in my arms and with a great cry of
pain i gathered her to me and kissed her lips sapt laid his hand on my
armi looked up in his face and i laid her softly on the ground and
stood up looking on her cursing heaven that young rupert s sword had
spared me for this sharper pang




chapter

if love were all


it was night and i was in the cell where in the king had la in in the
castle of zenda the great pipe that rupert of hentz au had nicknamed
jacobs ladder was gone and the lights in the room across the moat
twinkled in the darkness all was still the d in and clash of strife
were gone i had spent the day hidden in the forest from the time when
fritz had led me off leaving sapt with the princess undercover of
dusk muffled up i had been brought to the castle and lodged where i
now lay though three men had died there two of them by my hand i was
not troubled by ghosts i had thrown myself on a pallet by the window
and was looking out on the blackwater johann the keeper still pale
from his wound but not much hurt besides had brought me supper he
told me that the king was doing well that he had seen the princess
that she and he sapt and fritz had been long together marshal
strake nc z was gone to str elsa u black michael lay in his coffin and
antoinette dem au ban watched by him had i not heard from the chapel
priests singing mass for him

outside there were strange rumours afloat some said that the prisoner
of zenda was dead some that he had vanished yet alive some that he
was a friend who had served the king well in some adventure in england
others that he had discovered the dukes plots and had therefore been
kidnapped by him one or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said
only that they would say nothing but they had suspicions that more was
to be known than was known if colonels apt would tell all he knew

thus johann chattered till i sent him away and lay there alone
thinking not of the future but as a man is wont to do when stirring
things have happened to him rehearsing the events of the past weeks
and wondering how strangely they had fallen out and above me in the
stillness of the night i heard the standards flapping against their
poles for black michaels banner hung there half mast high and above
it the royal flag of ruritan i a floating for one night moreover my
head habit grows so quick that only by an effort did i recollect that
it floated no longer for me

presently fritz vont arlen heim came into the room i was standing then
by the window the glass was opened and i was idly fingering the cement
which clung to the masonry where jacobs ladder had been he told me
briefly that the king wanted me and together we crossed the drawbridge
and entered the room that had been black michaels

the king was lying there in bed our doctor from t arlen heim was in
attendance on him and whispered to me that my visit must be brief the
king held out his hand and shook mine fritz and the doctor withdrew to
the window

i took the kings ring from my finger and placed it on his

i have tried not to dishonour it sire said i

icant talk much to you he said in a weak voice i have had a
great fight with sapt and the marshal for we have told the marshal
everything i wanted to take you to str elsa u and keep you with me and
tell everyone of what you had done and you would have been my best and
nearest friend cousin rudolf but they tell me i must not and that the
secret must be kept if kept it can be

they are rights i re let me go my work here is done

yes it is done as no man but you could have done it when they see me
again i shall have my beard on i shall yes faith i shall be wasted
with sickness they will not wonder that the king looks changed in face
cousin i shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else you
have shown me how to play the king

sire said ii can take no praise from you it is by the narrowest
grace of god that i was not a worse traitor than your brother

he turned inquiring eyes on me but a sick man shrinks from puzzles
and he had no strength to question me his glance fell on flavia s
ring which i wore i though the would question me about it but after
fingering it idly hele this head fallon his pillow

i dont know when i shall see you again he said faintly almost
listlessly

if i can ever serve you again sire i answered

his eyelids closed fritz came with the doctor i kissed the kings
hand and let fritz lead me away i have never seen the king since

outside fritz turned not to the right back towards the drawbridge
but to the left and without speaking led me upstairs through a
handsome corridor in the chateau

where are we going i asked

looking away from me fritz answered

she has sent for you when it is overcome back to the bridge ill
wait for you there

what does she want said i breathing quickly

he shook his head

does she know everything

yes everything

he opened a door and gently pushing me in closed it behind me i found
myself in a drawing room small and richly furnished at first i thought
that i was alone for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles
on the mantelpiece was very dim but presently i discerned a womans
figure standing by the window i knew it was the princess and i walked
up to her fell on one knee and carried the hand that hung by her
side to my lips she neither moved nor spoke i rose to my feet and
piercing the gloom with my eager eyes saw her paleface and the gleam
of her hair and before i knew i spoke softly

flavia

she trembled a little and looked round then she darted to me taking
hold of me

dont stand dont stand no you must nt you re hurts it down here
here

she made me sit on as of a and put her hand on my forehead

how hot your head is she said sinking on her knees by me then she
laid her head against me and i heard her murmur my darling how hot
your head is

somehow love gives even to ad ullman the knowledge of his lovers
heart i had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption
but what i said now was

iloveyou with all my heart and soul

for what troubled and shamed her not her love for me but the fear that
i had counterfeited the lover as i had acted the king and taken her
kisses with a smothered smile

with all my life and heart said i as she clung to me always from
the first moment i saw you in the cathedral there has been but one
woman in the world to me and there will be no other but god forgive me
the wrong ive done you

they made you do it she said quickly and she added raising her head
and looking in my eyes it might have made no difference if id known
it it was always you never the king

i meant to tell you said ii was going to on the night of the
ball instr elsa u when sapt interrupted me after that i couldnt i
couldnt risk losing you before before i must my darling for you i
nearly left the king to die

i know i know what are we to do now rudolf

i put my arm round her and held her up while i said

i am going away tonight

ah no no she cried not tonight

i must go tonight before more people have seen me and how would you
have me stay sweetheart except

if i could come with you she whispered very low

my god said i roughly dont talkabout that and i thrust her a
little back from me

why not iloveyou you areas good a gentleman as the king

then i was false to all that i should have held by for i caught her in
my arms and prayed her in words that i will not write to come with me
daring all ruritan i a to take her from me and for a while she listened
with wondering dazzled eyes but as here yes looked on me i grew
ashamed and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammering sand
at last i was silent

she drew herself away from me and stood against the wall while is at
on the edge of the sofa trembling in every limb knowing what i had
done loathing it obstinate not to undo it so we rested along time

i am madi said sullenly

i love your madness dear she answered

her face was away from me but i caught the sparkle of a tear on her
cheek i clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there

is love the only things he asked in low sweet tones that seemed
to bring a calm even to my wrung heart if love were the only thing i
would follow you in rags if need be to the world send for you hold
my heart in the hollow of your hand but is love the only thing

i made no answer it gives me shame now to think that i would not help
her

she came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder i put my hand up and
held hers

i know people write and talk as if it were perhaps for some fate
lets it be a hifi were one of them but if love had been the only
thing you would have let the king die in his cell

i kissed her hand

honour binds a woman too rudolf my honour lies in being true to my
country and my house i dont know why god has let me love you but i
know that i must stay

still i said nothing and she pausing a while then went on

your ring will always be on my finger your heart inmyheart the
touch of your lipson mine but you must go and i must stay perhaps i
must do what it kills me to think of doing

i knew what she meant and a shiver ran through me but i could not
utterly fail her i rose and took her hand

do what you will or what you must i said i think god shows his
purposes to such as you my part is lighter for your ring shall be on
my finger and your heart in mine and no touch save of your lips will
ever be on mine so may god comfort you my darling

there struck on our ears the sound of singing the priests in the chapel
were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead they seemed to
chant a requiem over our buried joy to pray forgiveness for our love
that would not die the soft sweet pitiful music rose and fellas we
stood opposite one another her hands in mine

my queen and my beauty said i

my lover and true knights he said perhaps we shall never see one
another again kiss me my dear and go

i kissed her as she bade me but at the last she clung to me whispering
nothing but my name and that over and over again and again and again
and then i left her

rapidly i walked down to the bridges apt and fritz were waiting for me
under their directions i changed my dress and muffling my face as i
had done more than once before i mounted with them at the door of the
castle and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day
and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border
of ruritan i a the train was not quite due and i walked with them in a
meadow by a little brook while we waited for it they promised to
send me all news they overwhelmed me with kindness even olds apt was
touched to gentleness while fritz was half unmanned i listened in a
kind of dream to all they said rudolf rudolf rudolf still rang in
m years a burden of sorrow and of love at last they saw that i could
not heed them and we walked up and down in silence till fritz touched
me on the armand is awa mile or more away the blue smoke of the
train then i held out a hand to each of them

we are all but half men this morning said i smiling but we have
been men ehs apt and fritz old friends we have run a good course
between us

we have defeated traitors and set the king firm on his throne said
sapt

then fritz vont arlen heim suddenly before i could discern his purpose
or stay him uncovered his head and bent a she used to do and kissed my
hand and as i snatched it away he said trying to laugh

heaven doesnt always make the right men kings

olds apt twisted his mouth a she wrung my hand

the devil has his share in most things said he

the people at the station looked curiously at the tallman with the
muffled face but we took no notice of their glances i stood with my
two friends and waited till the train came up to us then we shook hands
again saying nothing and both this time and indeed from olds apt
it seemed strange bared their heads and so stood still till the train
bore me away from their sight so that it was thought some great man
travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that
morning whereas in truth it was only i rudolf ras send yll an english
gentleman a cadet of a good house but a man of no wealth nor position
nor of much rank they would have been disappointed to know that yet
had they known all they would have looked more curiously still for be
i what i might now i had been for three months a king which if not
a thing to be proud of is atleast an experience to have undergone
doubtless i should have thought more of it had there not echoed through
the air from the towers of zenda that we were leaving faraway into
m years and into my heart the cry of a womans love rudolf rudolf
rudolf

hark i hear it now




chapter

present past and future


the details of my return home can have but little interest i went
straight to the tyrol and spent a quiet fortnight mostly on my back
for a severe chill developed itself and i was also the victim of a
nervous reaction which made me weak as a baby as soon as i had reached
my quarters i sent an apparently careless postcard to my brother
announcing my good health and prospective return that would serve to
satisfy the inquiries as to my whereabouts which were probably still
vexing the prefect of the police of str elsa ui let my moustache and
imperial grow again and as hair comes quickly on my face they were
respectable though not luxuriant by the time that i landed myself in
paris and called on my friend george featherly my interview with
him was chiefly remarkable for the number of unwilling but necessary
falsehoods that it old and i rallied him unmercifully when he told me
that he had made up his mind that i had gone in the track of madame de
mau ban to str elsa u the lady it appeared was back in paris but was
living in great seclusion a fact for which gossip found no difficulty
in accounting did not all the world know of the treachery and death
of duke michael nevertheless george bade bertram bertrand be of good
cheer for said he flippantly alive poet is better than a dead
duke then he turned on me and asked

what have you been doing to your moustache

to tell the truth i answered assuming a sly air a man now and then
has reasons for wishing to alter his appearance but its coming on very
well again

what then i wasnt so far out if not the fair antoinette there was a
charmer

there is always a charmer said i sententious ly

but george would not be satisfied till he had wormed out of me he
took much pride in his ingenuity an absolutely imaginary love affair
attended with the proper so upon of scandal which had kept me all this
time in the peaceful regions of the tyrol in return for this
narrative george regaled me with a great deal of what he called inside
information known only to diplomatist sas to the true course of
events in ruritan i a the plots and counter plots in his opinion he told
me with a significant nod there was more to be said for black michael
than the public supposed and he hinted at a well founded suspicion that
the mysterious prisoner of zenda concerning whom a good many paragraphs
had appeared was not amanat all but here i had much a do not to
smile a woman disguised as a man and that strife between the king and
his brother for this imaginary ladys favour was at the bottom of their
quarrel

perhaps it was madame dem au ban herself i suggested

no said george decisively antoinette dem au ban was jealous of her
and betrayed the duke to the king for that reason and to confirm what
i say its well known that the princess flavia is now extremely cold to
the king after having been most affectionate

at this point i changed the subject and escaped from georges
inspired delusions but if diplomatist s never know anything more than
they had succeeded in finding out in this instance they appear to me to
be somewhat expensive luxuries

while in paris i wrote to antoinette though i did not venture to call
upon her i received in return a very affecting letter in which she
assured me that the kings generosity and kindness no less than her
regard for me bound her conscience to absolute secrecy she expressed
the intention of settling in the country and withdrawing herself
entirely from society whether she carried out her designs i have never
heard but as i have not met her or heard news of her up to this time
it is probable that she did there is no doubt that she was deeply
attached to the duke of str elsa u and her conduct at the time of his
death proved that no knowledge of the mans real character was enough to
root her regard for him out of her heart

i had one more battle left to fight a battle that would i knew be
severe and was bound to end in my complete defeat was i not back
from the tyrol without having made any study of its inhabitants
institutions scenery fauna flora or other features had i not simply
wasted my time in my usual frivolous good for nothing way that was the
aspect of the matter which i was obliged to admit would present itself
to my sister in law and against a verdict based on such evidence i had
really no defence to offer it maybe supposed then that i presented
myself in parklane in a shamefaced sheepish fashion on the whole my
reception was not so alarming as i had feared it turned out that i
had done not what rose wished but the next best thing what she
prophesied she had declared that i should make no notes record no
observations gather no materials my brother on the other hand
had been weak enough to maintain that a serious resolve had at length
animated me

when i returned empty handed rose was so occupied in triumphing over
burle sd on that she let me down quite easily devoting the greater
part of her reproaches to my failure to advertise my friends of my
whereabouts

weve wasted alot of time trying to find you she said

i know you have said i half our ambassadors have led weary lives
on my account george featherly told me so but why should you have been
anxious i can take care of myself

oh it wasnt that she cried scornfully but i wanted to tell you
about sir jacob b or rod a ile you know hes got an embassy atleast
he will have in a month and he wrote to say he hoped you would go with
him

where she going to

hes going to succeed lord topham at str elsa usaid she you couldnt
have a nicer place short of paris

str elsa uhm said i glancing at my brother

oh that doesnt matter exclaimed rose impatiently now you will
go wont you

i dont know that i care about it

oh you re too exasperating

and i dont think i can goto str elsa u my dear rose would it
be suitable

oh nobody remembers that horrid old story now

upon this i took out of my pocket a portrait of the king of ruritan i a
it had been taken a month or two before he ascended the throne she
could not miss my point when i said putting it into her hands

in case youve not seen or not noticed a picture of rudolf v there
he is dont you think they might recall the story if i appeared at the
court of ruritan i a

my sister in law looked at the portrait and then at me

good gracious she said and flung the photograph down on the table

what do you say bob i asked

burle sd on got up went to a corner of the room and searched in a heap
of newspapers presently he came back with a copy of the illustrated
london news opening the paper he displayed a double page engraving of
the coronation of rudolf vat str elsa u the photograph and the picture
he laid side by side is at at the table fronting them and as i
looked i grew absorbed my eye travelled from my own portrait to sapt
to strake nc z to the rich robes of the cardinal to black michaels
face to the stately figure of the princess by his side long i looked
and eagerly i was roused by my brothers hand on my shoulder he was
gazing down at me with a puzzled expression

its a remarkable likeness you see said ii really think i had
better not goto ruritan i a

rose though half convinced would not abandon her position

its just an excuse she said pettis hly you dont want to do
anything why you might become an ambassador

i dont think i want to bean ambassador said i

its more than you ever will be she retorted

that is very likely true but it is not more than i have been

the idea of being an ambassador could scarcely dazzle me i had been a
king

so pretty rose left us in dudgeon and burle sd on lighting a cigarette
looked at me still with that curious gaze

that picture in the paper he said

well what of it it shows that the king of ruritan i a and your humble
servant areas like as two peas

my brothers hook his head

i suppose so he said but i should know you from the man in the
photograph

and not from the picture in the paper

i should know the photograph from the picture the pictures very like
the photograph but

well

its more like you said my brother

my brother is a goodman and true so that for all that he is a married
man and mighty fond of his wife he should know any secret of mine but
this secret was not mine and i could not tell it to him

i dont think its so much like me as the photograph said i boldly
but anyhow bob i wont goto str elsa u

no dont goto str elsa u rudolf said he

and whether he suspects anything or has a glimmer of the truth i do
not know if he has he keeps it to himself and he and in ever refer to
it and we let sir jacob b or rod a ile find another attache

since all these events whose history i have set down happened i have
lived a very quiet life at a small house which i have taken in the
country the ordinary ambitions and aims of men in my position seem to
me dull and unattractive i have little fancy for the whirl of society
and none for the jostle of politics lady burle sd on utterly despairs of
me my neighbours think mean indolent dreamy unsociable fellow yet
i am a youngman and sometimes i have a fancy the superstitious would
call it a presentiment that my part in life is not yet altogether
played that somehow and someday i shall mix again in great affairs
i shall again spin policies in a busy brain match my wits against my
enemies brace my muscles to fight a good fight and strike stout blows
such is the tissue of my thoughts as with gun or rodin hand i wander
through the woods or by the side of the stream whether the fancy will
be fulfilled i can not tell still less whether the scene that led by
memory i lay for my new exploits will be the true one for i love to
see myself once again in the crowded streets of str elsa u or beneath the
frowning keep of the castle of zenda

thus led my brooding s leave the future and turn back on the past
shapes rise before me in long array the wild first revel with the king
the rush with my brave tea table the night in the moat the pursuit in
the forest my friends and my foes the people who learnt to love and
honour me the desperate men who tried to kill me and from amidst
these last comes one who alone of all of them yet moves on earth
though where i know not yet plans as i do not doubt wickedness yet
turns womens hearts to softness and mens to fear and hate where is
young rupert of hentz au the boy who came so night o beating me when
his name comes into my head i feel my handgrip and the blood move
quicker through my veins and the hint of fate the presentiment seems
to grow stronger and more definite and to whisper insistently in m year
that i have yet a hand to play with young rupert therefore i exercise
myself in arms and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth
must leave me

one break comes every year in my quiet life then i goto dresden and
there i am met by my dear friend and companion fritz vont arlen heim
last time his pretty wife helga came and a lusty crowing baby with
her and for a week fritz and i are together and i hear all of what
falls out instr elsa u and in the evenings as we walk and smoke
together we talk of sapt and of the king and often of young rupert
and as the hours grow small at last we speak of flavia for every year
fritz carries with him to dresden a little box in it lies a red rose
and round the stalk of the rose is a slip of paper with the words
written rudolf flavia always and the like is end back by him that
message and the wearing of the rings are all that now bind me and the
queen of ruritan i a for nobler as i hold her for the act she has
followed where her duty to her country and her house led her and is the
wife of the king uniting his subjects to him by the love they bear to
her giving peace and quiet days to thousands by herself sacrifice
there are moments when id are not think of it but there are others when
i rise in spirit to where she ever dwells then i can thank god that i
love the noblest lady in the world the most gracious and beautiful and
that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high
duty

shall i see her face again the paleface and the glorious hair of that
i know nothing fate has no hint my heart no presentiment i do not
know in this world perhaps nay it is likely never and can it
be that somewhere in a manner where of our flesh bound minds have no
apprehension she and i will be together again with nothing to come
between us nothing to forbid our love that i know not nor wiser heads
than mine but if it be never if i can never hold sweet converse again
with her or lookup on her face or know from her her love why then
this side the grave i will live as becomes the man whom she loves and
for the other side i must pray a dreamless sleep

chapter i
treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the
circumstances attending his birth


among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will
assign no fictitious name there is one anciently common to most towns
great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born on
a day and date which i need not trouble myself to repeat inasmuch as
it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of
the business at all events the item of mortality whose name is
prefixed to the head of this chapter

for along time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared or if they had that being comprised within a couple of
pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the
literature of any age or country

although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly be fall a human being i do mean to say that in this
particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could
by possibility have occurred the fact is that there was considerable
difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of
respiration a troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence and for sometime he lay gasping on a
little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and
the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter now if
during this brief period oliver had been surrounded by careful
grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of
profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been
killed in no time there being nobody by however but a pauper old
woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer
and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract oliver and
nature fought out the point between them the result was that after a
few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to
the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter

as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his
lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over their on
bedstead rustled the paleface of a young woman was raised feebly
from the pillow and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words
let me see the child and die

the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire
giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately as the
young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with
more kindness than might have been expected of him

oh you must not talkabout dying yet

l or bless her dear heart no interposed the nurse hastily
depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which
she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction

l or bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as i have sir
and had thirteen children of her own and all one m dead except two
and them in the wu rk us with me shell know better than to take on in
that way bless her dear heart think what it is to beam other
theresa dear young lamb do

apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed
in producing its due effect the patients hook her head and stretched
out her hand towards the child

the surgeon deposited it in her arms she imprinted her cold white lips
passionately on its forehead passed her hands over her face gazed
wildly round shuddered fell back and died they chafed her breast
hands and temples but the blood had stopped forever they talked of
hope and comfort they had been strangers too long

its all over mrs thin gummy said the surgeon at last

ah poor dear so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the
green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to
take up the child poor dear

you need nt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said
the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation its very
likely it will be troublesome give it a little gruel if it is he
put on his hat and pausing by the bedside on his way to the door
added she was a good looking girl too where did she come from

she was brought here last night replied the old woman by the
overseers order she was found lying in the street she had walked
some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came
from or where she was going to nobody knows

the surgeon leaned over the body and raised the lefthand the old
story he said shaking his head no wedding ring i see ah
goodnight

the medical gentleman walked away to dinner and the nurse having once
more applied herself to the green bottles at down on a low chair
before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant

what an excellent example of the power of dress young oliver twist
was wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only
covering he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar it
would have been hard for the haught i est stranger to have assigned him
his proper station in society but now that he was enveloped in the old
calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged
and ticketed and fell into his place at once a parish child the orphan
of a workhouse the humble half starved drudge to be cuffed and
buffeted through the world despised by all and pitied by none

oliver cried lustily if he could have known that he was an orphan
left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers perhaps he
would have cried the louder




chapter ii
treats of oliver twists growth education and board


for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic
course of treachery and deception he was brought up by hand the
hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities the parish
authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether
there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a
situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of
which he stood in need the workhouse authorities replied with
humility that there was not upon this the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed
or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branch workhouse
some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
against the poor laws rolled about the floor all day without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and
for the consideration of seven pence halfpenny per small head per week
seven pence halfpenny s worth per week is a good round diet for a child
a great deal maybe got for seven pence halfpenny quite enough to
overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable the elderly female was
a woman of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for children
and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself
so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own
use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
allowance than was originally provided for them thereby finding in the
lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great
experimental philosopher

everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who
demonstrated it so well that he had go this own horse down to a straw
a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
ramp a cious animal on nothing at all if he had not died
four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable
bait of air unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the
female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a
similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at
the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen
in eight and a half cases out often either that it sickened from want
and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got half smothered by
accident in anyone of which cases the miserable little being was
usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers
it had never known in this

occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
washing though the latter accident was very scarce anything
approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm the jury
would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the
parishioners would rebellious ly affix their signatures to a
remonstrance but these impertinence s were speedily checked by the
evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was
very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
the parish wanted which was very self devotional besides the board
made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the
day before to say they were going the children were neat and clean to
behold when they went and what more would the people have

it can not be expected that this system of farming would produce any
very extraordinary or luxuriant crop oliver twists ninth birthday
found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and
decidedly small in circumference but nature or inheritance had
implanted a good sturdy spirit in olivers breast it had had plenty of
room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and
perhaps to this circumstance maybe attributed his having any ninth
birthday at all be this as it may however it was his ninth
birthday and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party
of two other young gentleman who after participating with him in a
sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be
hungry when mrs mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly
startled by the apparition of mr bumble the beadle striving to undo
the wicket of the garden gate

goodness gracious is that you mr bumble sir said mrs mann
thrusting her head out of the window in well affected ecstasies of joy
susan take oliver and them two brats upstairs and was hem
directly my heart alive mr bumble how glad i am to see you
surely

now mr bumble was a fatman and a choleric so instead of
responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave
the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick
which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles

l or only think said mrs mann running out for the three boys had
been removed by this time only think of that that i should have
forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them
dear children walk in sir walk in pray mr bumble do sir

although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
softened the heart of a churchwarden it by no means mollified the
beadle

do you think this respectful or proper conduct mrs mann inquired
mr bumble grasping his cane to keep the parish officers awaiting
at your garden gate when they come here upon p orochi al business with
the p orochi al orphans are you a weer mrs mann that you areas i may
say ap orochi al delegate and a stipendiary

im sure mr bumble that i was only a telling one or two of the dear
children as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied mrs
mann with great humility

mr bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his
importance he had displayed the one and vindicated the other he
relaxed

well well mrs mann he replied in a calmer tone it maybe as you
say it maybe lead the way in mrs mann for i come on business and
have something to say

mrs mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor
placed a seat for him and officious ly deposited his cocked hat and
cane on the table before him mr bumble wiped from his forehead the
perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the
cocked hat and smiled yes he smiled beadles are but men and mr
bumble smiled

now dont you be offended at what ima going to say observed mrs
mann with captivating sweetness youve had along walk you know or
i wouldnt mention it now will you take a little drop of some think
mr bumble

not a drop nora drop said mr bumble waving his righthand in a
dignified but placid manner

i think you will said mrs mann who had noticed the tone of the
refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it just a leetle drop
with a little coldwater and a lump of sugar

mr bumble coughed

now just a leetle drop said mrs mann persuasively

what is it inquired the beadle

why its what im obliged to keep a little of in the house to put
into the blessed infants daffy when they a int well mr bumble
replied mrs mann as she opened a corner cupboard and took down a
bottle and glass its g in ill not deceive you mr bits g in

do you give the children daffy mrs mann inquired bumble following
with his eyes the interesting process of mixing

ah bless em that i do dear as it is replied the nurse i
couldnt see em suffer before my very eyes you know sir

no said mr bumble approvingly no you could not you area humane
woman mrs mann here she set down the glass i shall take a early
opportunity of mentioning it to the board mrs mann he drew it
towards him you feel as am other mrs mann he stirred the
g in and water ii drink your health with cheerfulness mrs mann
and he swallowed half of it

and now about business said the beadle taking out a leather n
pocketbook the child that was half baptized oliver twist is nine
year old today

bless him interposed mrs mann inflaming her left eye with the
corner of her apron

and notwithstanding a offered reward often pound which was
afterwards increased to twenty pound notwithstanding the most
superlative and i may say super natra l exertions on the part of this
parish said bumble we have never be enable to discover who is his
father or what was his mothers settlement name or condition

mrs mann raised her hands in astonishment but added after a moments
reflection how comes he to have any name at all then

the beadle drew himself up with great pride and said i in went edit

you mr bumble

i mrs mann we name our fondling sin alphabetical order the last
was ass wub blei named him this was at twist i named him the
next one comes will be unwin and the next vil kins i have got names
readymade to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it
again when we come to z

why you re quite a literary character sir said mrs mann

well well said the beadle evidently gratified with the compliment
perhaps i maybe perhaps i maybe mrs mann he finished the
g in and water and added oliver being now too old to remain here the
board have determined to have him back into the house i have come out
myself to take him there so let me see him at once

ill fetch him directly said mrs mann leaving the room for that
purpose oliver having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed
off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent
protect ress

make a bow to the gentleman oliver said mrs mann

oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair
and the cocked hat on the table

will you go along with me oliver said mr bumble in a majestic
voice

oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of mrs mann who had
got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a
furious countenance he took the hint at once for the fist had been
too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his
recollection

will she go with me inquired poor oliver

no she cant replied mr bumble but shell come and see you
sometimes

this was no very great consolation to the child young a she was
however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at
going away it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears
into his eyes hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you
want to cry and oliver cried very naturally indeed mrs mann gave him
a thousand embraces and what oliver wanted a great deal more a piece
of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got to the
workhouse with the slice of bread in his hand and the little
brown cloth parish cap on his head oliver was then led away by mr
bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never
lighted the gloom of his infant years and ye the burst into an agony
of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him wretched as
were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were
the only friends he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in
the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time

mr bumble walked on with long strides little oliver firmly grasping
his gold laced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every
quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there to these
interrogations mr bumble returned very brief and snappish replies for
the temporary blandness which g in and water awakens in some bosoms had
by this time evaporated and he was once again a beadle

oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread when mr bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old
woman returned and telling him it was aboard night informed him
that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith

not having a very clearly defined notion of what alive board was
oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite
certain whether he ought to laugh or cry he had no time to think about
the matter however for mr bumble gave him a tap on the head with
his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively
and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large whitewashed
room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table at
the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher than the
rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round redface

bow to the board said bumble oliver brushed away two or three tears
that were lingering in his eyes and seeing no board but the table
fortunately bowed to that

whats your name boy said the gentleman in the highchair

oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him
tremble and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him
cry these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating
voice whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool
which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite
a this ease

boy said the gentleman in the highchair listen to me you know
your ean orphan i suppose

whats that sir inquired poor oliver

the boy is a fool i though the was said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat

hush said the gentleman who had spoken first you know youve got
no father or mother and that you were brought up by the parish dont
you

yessir replied oliver weeping bitterly

what are you crying for inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat and to be sure it was very extraordinary what could the
boy be crying for

i hope you say your prayers everynight said another gentleman in a
gruff voice and pray for the people who feed you and take care of
you like a christian

yessir stammered the boy the gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right it would have been very like a christian and a
marvellously good christian too if oliver had prayed for the people
who fed and took care of him but he hadnt because nobody had
taught him

well you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade
said the red faced gentleman in the highchair

so youll begin to pick oak um tomorrow morning at six oclock added
the surly one in the white waistcoat

for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process
of picking oak um oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and
was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard bed he
sobbed himself to sleep what a novel illustration of the tender laws
of england they let the paupers goto sleep

poor oliver he little thought a she lay sleeping in happy
unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day
arrive data decision which would exercise the most material influence
overall his future fortunes but they had and this was it

the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men and
when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out
at once what ordinary folks would never have discovered the poor
people liked it it was a regular place of public entertainment for the
poorer classes a tavern where there was nothing to pay a public
breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year round a brick and
mortar elysium where it was all play and now or koho said the
board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights
well stop it all in no time so they established the rule that all
poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody
not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house or by a
quick one out of it with this view they contracted with the
waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water and with a
corn factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and
issued three meals of thing ruel a day with an onion twice a week and
half a roll of sundays they made a great many otherwise and humane
regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary
to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in
consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons and
instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had
theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a
bachelor there is no saying how many applicants for relief under
these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society
if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but the board were
long headed men and had provided for this difficulty the relief was
inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened
people

for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was
in full operation it was rather expensive at first in consequence of
the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in
the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their
wasted shrunken forms after a week or two s gruel but the number of
workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were
in ecstasies

the room in which the boys were fed was a largest one hall with a
copper at one end out of which the master dressed in an apron for the
purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at
mealtimes of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and
no more except on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two
ounces and a quarter of bread besides

the bowls never wanted washing the boys polished them with their
spoon still they shone again and when they had performed this
operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large
as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager
eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers
most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
gruel that might have been cast there on boys have generally excellent
appetites oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and
wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt
been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small
cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another
basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to
eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of
tender age he had a wild hungry eye and they implicitly believed
him a council was held lots were cast who should walkup to the
master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to
oliver twist

the evening arrived the boys took their places the master in his
cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and along
grace was said over the short commons the gruel disappeared the boys
whispered each other and winked at oliver while his next neighbors
nudged him child a she was he was desperate with hunger and reckless
with misery he rose from the table and advancing to the master basin
and spoon in hand said somewhat alarmed a this own temerity

please siri want some more

the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale he gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then
clung for support to the copper the assistants were paralysed with
wonder the boys with fear

what said the master at length in a faint voice

please sir replied oliveri want some more

the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle pinioned him
in his armand shrieked aloud for the beadle

the board were sitting in solemn conclave when mr bumble rushed into
the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high
chair said

mr limb kins i beg your pardon sir oliver twist has asked for
more

there was a general start horror was depicted on every countenance

for more said mr limb kins compose yourself bumble and answer
me distinctly do i understand that he asked for more after he had
eaten the supper allotted by the dietary

he did sir replied bumble

that boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat i
know that boy will be hung

nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion an animated
discussion took place oliver was ordered into instant confinement and
a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering a
reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the
hands of the parish in other words five pounds and oliver twist were
offered to any manor woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade
business or calling

in ever was more convinced of anything in my life said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat a she knocked at the gate and read the bill
next morning in ever was more convinced of anything in my life than
i am that that boy will come to be hung

as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waist coated
gentleman was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this
narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint
just yet whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination
or no




chapter iii
relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not
have been a sinecure


for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
the board it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose
that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have
established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for
ever by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the
wall and attaching himself to the other to the performance of this
feat however there was one obstacle namely that
pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for
all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals there was a still greater
obstacle in olivers youth and childishness he only cried bitterly all
day and when the long dismal night came on spread his little hands
before his eyes to shutout the darkness and crouching in the corner
tried to sleep ever and an on waking with a start and tremble and
drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its
cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which
surrounded him

let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the
period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious
consolation as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was
allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a
stone yard in the presence of mr bumble who prevented his catching
cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated
applications of the cane as for society he was carried every other
day into the hall where the boys dined and there soci ably flogged as a
public warning and example and so far from being denied the advantages
of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every
evening at prayer time and there permitted to listen to and console
his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special
clause there in inserted by authority of the board in which they
entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be
guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist whom the supplication
distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection
of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory
of the very devil himself

it chance done morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious
and comfortable state that mrg am field chimney sweep went his way
down the high street deeply cog it ating in his mind his ways and means
of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become
rather pressing mrg am fields most sanguine estimate of his finances
could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount
and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately
cudgel ling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his
eyes encountered the bill on the gate

woo said mrg am field to the donkey

the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably
whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbages talk or two when
he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward

mrg am field growled a fierce im pre cation on the donkey generally but
more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow
on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a
donkeys then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jawa sharp
wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was no this own master and
by these means turned him round he then gave him another blow on the
head just to stun him till he came back again having completed these
arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill

the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound
sentiments in the boardroom having witnessed the little dispute
between mrg am field and the donkey he smiled joyously when that
person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that mrg am field
was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted mrg am field
smiled too a she per used the document for five pounds was just the
sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was
encumbered mrg am field knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just th everything
for register stoves so he spelt the bill through again from
beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility
accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat

this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said mr
gam field

ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a
condescending smile what of him

if the parish v ould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a
good spec table chim bley sweep in b is ness said mrg am field i wants
a prentis and i am ready to take him

walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat mrg am field
having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head
and another wrench of the ja was a caution not to runaway in his
absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room
where oliver had first seen him

its a nasty trade said mr limb kins when gam field had again stated
his wish

young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another
gentleman

that sa cause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chim bley
to make em come down again said gam field thats all smoke and no
blaze vere as smoke a into no use at all in making a boy come down
for it only sinds him to sleep and that swo the likes boys is wery
obst in it and wery lazy genl men and theres no think like a good hot
blaze to make em come down vi thar units humane too genl men
a cause even if theyve stuck in the chim bley roasting their feet
makes em struggle to h extricate theirselves

the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr
limb kins the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a
few minutes but in so low at one that the words saving of
expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report
published were alone audible these only chanced to be heard indeed
or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis

at length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having
resumed their seats and their solemnity mr limb kins said

we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it

not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat

decidedly not added the other members

as mrg am field did happen to labour under the slight imputation of
having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him
that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into
their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their
proceedings it was very unlike their general mode of doing business
if they had but still a she had no particular wish to revive the
rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the
table

so you wont let me have him genl men said mrg am field pausing
near the door

no replied mr limb kins atleast as its a nasty business we
think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered

mrg am fields countenance brightened as with a quickstep he
returned to the table and said

what ll you give genl men come dont be too hard on a poorman
what ll you give

i should say three pound ten was plenty said mr limb kins

ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat

come said gam field say four pound genl men say four pound and
youve got rid of him for good and all there

three pound ten repeated mr limb kins firmly

come ill split the difference genl men urged gam field three
pound fifteen

not a farthing more was the firm reply of mr limb kins

you re desperate hard upon me genl men said gam field wavering

pooh pooh nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium take him you silly
fellow hes just the boy for you he wants the stick now and then
itll do him good and his board need nt come very expensive for he
hasnt been overfed since he was born hahaha

mrg am field gave an arch look at the faces round the table and
observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself
the bargain was made mr bumble was at once instructed that oliver
twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for
signature and approval that very afternoon

in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive
astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself
into a clean shirt he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
performance when mr bumble brought him with his own hands a basin
of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of
bread at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously
thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill
him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten
him up in that way

dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful
said mr bumble in at one of impressive pomposity your ea going to
be made a prentice of oliver

a prentice sir said the child trembling

yes oliver said mr bumble the kind and blessed gentleman which
is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own are
a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of
you although the expense to the parish is three pound ten three pound
ten oliver seventy shill ins one hundred and forty sixpence sand all
for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love

as mr bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in
an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he
sobbed bitterly

come said mr bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying
to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced
come oliver wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont
cry into your gruel that savery foolish action oliver it
certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already

on their way to the magistrate mr bumble instructed oliver that all
he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the
gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like
it very much indeed both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey
the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in
either particular there was no telling what would be done to him when
they arrived at the office he was shutup in a little room by himself
and admonished by mr bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch
him

there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour at
the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head unadorned
with the cocked hat and said aloud

now oliver my dear come to the gentleman as mr bumble said this
he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice mind
what it old you you young rascal

oliver stared innocently in mr bumbles face at this somewhat
contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his
offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining
room the door of which was open it was a large room with a great
window behind a desks at two old gentleman with powdered heads one
of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with
the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of
parchment which lay before him mr limb kins was standing in front of
the desk on one side and mrg am field with a partially washed face
on the other while two or three bluff looking men in top boots were
lounging about

the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the
littlebit of parchment and there was a short pause after oliver had
been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk

this is the boy your worship said mr bumble

the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon
the last mentioned old gentleman woke up

oh is this the boy said the old gentleman

this is him sir replied mr bumble bow to the magistrate my
dear

oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance he had been
wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all
boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards
from thenceforth on that account

well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of
chimney sweeping

he do at son it your worship replied bumble giving oliver a sly
pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt

and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman

if we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed runaway
simultaneous your worship replied bumble

and this man thats to be his master you sir youll treat him well
and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you said the old
gentleman

when i says i will i means i will replied mrg am field doggedly

your ea rough speaker my friend but you look an honest
open hearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in
the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villainous
countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty but the
magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably
be expected to discern what other people did

i hope i am sir said mrg am field with an ugly leer

i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing
his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the
ink stand

it was the critical moment of olivers fate if the ink stand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen
into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been
straightway hurried off but as it chanced to be immediately under his
nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his
desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his
search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and
terrified face of oliver twist who despite all the ad monitory looks
and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his
future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too
palpable to be mistaken even by a half blind magistrate

the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to
mr limb kins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and
unconcerned aspect

my boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed what is
the matter

stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate
laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of
interest now boy tell us whats the matter dont be afraid

oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that
they would order him back to the darkroom that they would starve
him beat him kill him if they pleased rather than send him away with
that dreadful man

well said mr bumble raising his hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity well of all the artful and designing orphans
that ever i see oliver you are one of the most barefaced est

hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when mr
bumble had given vent to this compound adjective

i beg your worships pardon said mr bumble incredulous of having
heard a right did your worship speak to me

yes hold your tongue

mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment a beadle ordered to hold
his tongue a moral revolution

the old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked a this
companion he nodded significantly

we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman
tossing aside the piece of parchment a she spoke

i hope stammered mr limb kins i hope the magistrates will not form
the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child

the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
matter said the second old gentleman sharply take the boy back to
the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it

that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he
would be drawn and quartered into the bargain mr bumble shook his
head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good
whereunto mrg am field replied that he wished he might come to him
which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem
to be a wish of a totally opposite description

the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was
again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would
take possession of him




chapter iv
oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public
life


in great families when an advantageous place can not be obtained
either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the
youngman who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to
sea the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took
counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in
some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port this
suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
with him the probability being that the skipper would flog him to
death in a playful mood someday after dinner or would knock his
brains out with an iron bar both pastimes being as is pretty
generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
of that class the more the case presented itself to the board in this
point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared
so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for
oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay

mr bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries
with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a
cabin boy without any friends and was returning to the workhouse to
communicate the result of his mission when he encountered at the gate
no less a person than mr sower berry the parochial undertaker

mr sower berry was at all gaunt large jointed man attired in a suit
of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour
and shoes to answer his features were not naturally intended to wear a
smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional
jo co sity his step was elastic and his face betokened inward
pleasantry a she advanced to mr bumble and shook him cordially by
the hand

i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr
bumble said the undertaker

youll make your fortune mr sower berry said the beadle a she
thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff box of the
undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin i
say youll make your fortune mr sower berry repeated mr bumble
tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his
cane

think so said the undertaker in at one which half admitted and half
disputed the probability of the event the prices allowed by the board
are very small mr bumble

so are the coffins replied the beadle with precisely as near an
approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in

mr sower berry was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be
and laughed along time without cessation well well mr bumble he
said at length theres no denying that since the new system of
feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more
shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble
well seasoned timber is an expensive articles i randall their on
handles come by canal from birmingham

well well said mr bumble every trade has its drawbacks a fair
profit is of course allowable

of course of course replied the undertaker and if i dont get a
profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the
long run you see hehehe

just so said mr bumble

though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of
observations which the beadle had interrupted though i must say mr
bumble that i have to contend against on every great disadvantage
which is that all the stout people go off the quickest the people who
have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first
to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble
that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great hole in
ones profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir

as mr sower berry said this with the becoming indignation of an
ill used man and as mr bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a
reflection on the honour of the parish the latter gentleman thought it
advisable to change the subject oliver twist being uppermost in his
mind he made him his theme

by the bye said mr bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy
do you ap orochi al prentis who is at present a deadweight a
millstone as i may say round the p orochi al throat liberal terms mr
sower berry liberal terms as mr bumble spoke he raised his cane to
the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words five
pounds which were printed there on in roman capitals of gigantic size

gad so said the undertaker taking mr bumble by the gilt edged
l appel of his official coat thats just th everything i wanted to
speak to you about you know dear me what a very elegant button this
is mr bumble in ever noticed it before

yes i think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly
downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat the
die is the same as the p orochi al seal the good samaritan healing the
sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on new years
morning mr sower berry i put it on i remember for the first time
to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway
at midnight

i recollect said the undertaker the jury brought it in died from
exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life
didnt they

mr bumble nodded

and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by
adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had

tush foolery interposed the beadle if the board attended to all
the nonsense that ignorant jury men talk they d have enough to do

very true said the undertaker they would indeed

juries said mr bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont
when working into a passion juries is in ed dicated vulgar grovelling
wretches

so they are said the undertaker

they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than
that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously

no more they have acquiesced the undertaker

i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face

so do i rejoined the undertaker

and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for
a week or two said the beadle the rules and regulations of the
board would soon bring their spirit down for em

let em alone for that replied the undertaker so saying he smiled
approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer

mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat took a handkerchief from the
inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his
rage had engendered fixed the cocked hat on again and turning to the
undertaker said in a calmer voice

well what about the boy

oh replied the undertaker why you know mr bumble i pay a good
deal towards the poors rates

hem said mr bumble well

well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much
toward semi vea right to get as much out of emas i can mr
bumble and so i think ill take the boy myself

mr bumble grasped the undertaker by the armand led him into the
building mr sower berry was closeted with the board for five minutes
and it was arranged that oliver should goto him that evening upon
liking a phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that
if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough workout
of a boy without putting too much food into him he shall have him for
a term of years to do what he likes with

when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening and
informed that he was to go that night as general house lad to a
coffin makers and that if he complained of his situation or ever
came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be
drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so
little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened
young rascal and ordered mr bumble to remove him forthwith

now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the
world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror
at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they
were rather out in this particular instance the simple fact was that
oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too
much and was in a fairway of being reduced for life to a state of
brutal stupidity and sullen ness by the ill usage he had received he
heard the news of his destination in perfect silence and having had
his luggage put into his hand which was not very difficult to carry
inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper
parcel about half a foot square by three inches deep he pulled his cap
over his eyes and once more attaching himself to mr bumbles coat
cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering

for sometime mr bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark
for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should
and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by
the skirts of mr bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to
great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches as
they drew near to their destination however mr bumble thought it
expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for
inspection by his new master which he accordingly did with a fit and
becoming air of gracious patronage

oliver said mr bumble

yessir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice

pull that cap off your eyes and holdup your head sir

although oliver did a she was desired at once and passed the back of
his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them
when he looked up a this conductor as mr bumble gazed sternly upon
him it rolled down his cheek it was followed by another and another
the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one
withdrawing his other hand from mr bumble she covered his face with
both and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and
bony fingers

well exclaimed mr bumble stopping short and darting a this little
charge a look of intense malignity well of all the ungrateful lest
and worst disposed boys as ever i see oliver you are the

no no sir sobbed oliver clinging to the hand which held the
well known cane no no siri will be good indeed indeed indeed i
will siri am a very little boy sir and it is so so

so what inquired mr bumble in amazement

so lonely sir so very lonely cried the child everybody hates me
oh sir dont dont pray be cross to me the child be a this hand
upon his heart and looked in his companions face with tears of real
agony

mr bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some
astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four times in a husky
manner and after muttering something about that troublesome cough
bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy then once more taking his
hand he walked on with him in silence

the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was
making some entries in his day book by the light of a most appropriate
dismal candle when mr bumble entered

a has aid the undertaker looking up from the book and pausing in
the middle of a word is that you bumble

no one else mr sower berry replied the beadle here ive brought
the boy oliver made a bow

oh thats the boy is it said the undertaker raising the candle
above his head to get a better view of oliver mrs sower berry will
you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear

mrs sower berry emerged from a little room behind the shop and
presented the form of a short thin squeezed up woman with a vixen ish
countenance

my dear said mr sower berry deferentially this is the boy from
the workhouse that it old you of oliver bowed again

dear me said the undertakers wife hes very small

why he is rather small replied mr bumble looking at oliver as
if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is small theres no
denying it but hell grow mrs sower berry hell grow

a hi daresay he will replied the lady pettis h lyon our victuals
and our drink i see no saving in parish children not i for they
always cost more to keep than they re worth however men always think
they know best there get downstairs little bago bones with this
the undertakers wife opened aside door and pushed oliver down a
steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the
anteroom to the coal cellar and denominated kitchen where in sata
slatter nly girl in shoes down a the el and blue worsted stockings very
much out of repair

here charlotte said mr sower berry who had followed oliver down
give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip he
hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without e mid are
say the boy isnt too dainty to eat em are you boy

oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was
trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a
plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him

i wish some well fed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall
within him whose blood is ice whose heart is iron could have seen
oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver
to re the bits as under with all the ferocity of famine there is only
one thing i should like better and that would be to see the
philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish

well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his
supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful
auguri es of his future appetite have you done

there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the
affirmative

then come with me said mrs sower berry taking up a dim and dirty
lamp and leading the way upstairs your beds under the counter you
dont mind sleeping among the coffins i suppose but it doesnt much
matter whether you door dont for you cant sleep anywhere else
come dont keep me here all night

oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress




chapter v
oliver mingles with new associates going to a funeral for the first
time he forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business


oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp
down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling
of a we and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be
at no loss to understand an unfinished coffin on black tressel s which
stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and death like that a
cold tremble came over him everytime his eyes wandered in the
direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see
some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror
against the wall were ranged in regular array along row of elm
boards cut in the same shape looking in the dim light like
high shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets
coffin plates elm chips bright headed nails and shreds of black
cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was
ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff
neck cloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by
four black steeds approaching in the distance the shop was close and
hot the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins the
recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust
looked like a grave

nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver he was
alone in a strange place and we all know how chilled and desolate the
best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation the boy had no
friends to care for or to care for him the regret of no recent
separation was fresh in his mind the absence of no loved and
well remembered face sank heavily into his heart

but his heart was heavy notwithstanding and he wished a she crept
into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be
la in in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the
tallgrass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep
bell to soothe him in his sleep

oliver was awakened in the morning by aloud kicking at the outside of
the shop door which before he could huddle on his clothes was
repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twenty five times
when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began

open the door will yer cried the voice which belonged to the legs
which had kicked at the door

i will directly sir replied oliver undoing the chain and turning
the key

i suppose yer the new boy a in tyer said the voice through the
keyhole

yessir replied oliver

how old are yer inquired the voice

ten sir replied oliver

then ill who p yer when i get in said the voice you just see if i
dont thats all my work us brat and having made this obliging
promise the voice began to whistle

oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive mono syllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the
smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would
redeem his pledge most honourably he drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand and opened the door

for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street
and over the way impressed with the belief that the unknown who had
addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm
himself for nobody did he see but a big charity boy sitting on a post
in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut
into wedges the size of his mouth with a clasp knife and then
consumed with great dexterity

i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length seeing that no other
visitor made his appearance did you knock

i kicked replied the charity boy

did you want a coffin sir inquired oliver innocently

at this the charity boy looked monstrous fierce and said that oliver
would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that
way

yer dont know who i am i suppose work us said the charity boy in
continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with
edifying gravity

no sir rejoined oliver

im mister noah clay pole said the charity boy and you re under me
takedown the shutters yer idle young ruffian with this mr
clay pole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a
dignified air which did him great credit it is difficult for a
large headed small eyed youth of lumbering make and heavy
countenance to look dignified under any circumstances but it is more
especially so when super added to these personal attractions area red
nose and yellow smalls

oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in
his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a
small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the
day was graciously assisted by noah who having consoled him with the
assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him mr
sower berry came down soon after shortly afterwards mrs sower berry
appeared oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs
prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast

come near the fire noah said charlotte is aveda nice littlebit
of bacon for you from masters breakfast oliver shut that door at
mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover
of the bread panther es your tea take it away to that box and drink
it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop dye
hear

dye hear work us said noah clay pole

l or noah said charlotte what arum creature you are why dont
you let the boy alone

let him alone said noah why everybody lets him alone enough for
the matter of that neither his father nor his mother will ever
interfere with him all his relations let him have his own way pretty
well eh charlotte hehehe

oh you queer soul said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in
which she was joined by noah after which they both looked scornfully
at poor oliver twist ashes at shivering on the box in the coldest
corner of the room an date the stale pieces which had been specially
reserved for him

noah was a charity boy but not a workhouse orphan no chance child was
he for he could trace his genealogy all the wayback to his parents
who lived hard by his mother being a washerwoman and his father a
drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of
twopence halfpenny and an un state able fraction the shop boys in the
neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding noah in the public
streets with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and
the like and noah had bourne them without reply but now that fortune
had cast in his way a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could
point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest this
affords charming food for contemplation it shows us what a beautiful
thing human nature maybe made to be and how impartially the same
amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest
charity boy

oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a
month mr and mrs sower berry the shop being shutup were taking their
supper in the little back parlour when mr sower berry after several
deferential glances a this wife said

my dear he was going to say more but mrs sower berry looking up
with a peculiarly un propitious aspect he stopped short

well said mrs sower berry sharply

nothing my dear nothing said mr sower berry

ugh you brute said mrs sower berry

not at all my dear said mr sower berry humbly i thought you
didnt want to hear my dear i was only going to say

oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed mrs
sower berry i am nobody dont consult me pray i dont want to
intrude upon your secrets as mrs sower berry said this she gave an
hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences

but my dear said sower berry i want to ask your advice

no no dont ask mine replied mrs sower berry in an affecting
manner ask somebody elses here there was another hysterical
laugh which frightened mr sower berry very much this is a very common
and much approved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very
effective it at once reduced mr sower berry to begging as a special
favour to be allowed to say what mrs sower berry was most curious to
hear after a short duration the permission was most graciously
conceded

its only about young twist my dear said mr sower berry a very
good looking boy that my dear

he need be for he eats enough observed the lady

there san expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed mr
sower berry which is very interesting he would make a delightful
mute my love

mrs sower berry looked up with an expression of considerable
wonderment mr sower berry remarked it and without allowing time for
any observation on the good ladys part proceeded

i dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but
only for childrens practice it would be very new to have a mute in
proportion my dear you may depend upon it it would have a superb
effect

mrs sower berry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way
was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been
compromising her dignity to have said sounder existing circumstances
she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious
suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before mr
sower berry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his
proposition it was speedily determined therefore that oliver should
beat once initiated into the mysteries of the trade and with this
view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of
his services being required

the occasion was not long incoming half an hour after breakfast next
morning mr bumble entered the shop and supporting his cane against
the counter drew forth his large leather n pocketbook from which he
selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sower berry

a has aid the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance
an order for a coffin eh

for a coffin first and ap orochi al funeral afterwards replied mr
bumble fastening the strap of the leather n pocketbook which like
himself was very corpulent

bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to mr
bumble in ever heard the name before

bumble shook his head a she replied obstinate people mr
sower berry very obstinate proud too im afraid sir

proud eh exclaimed mr sower berry with a sneer come thats too
much

oh its sickening replied the beadle anti monia lmr sower berry

so it is acquiesced the undertaker

we only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle
and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman
who lodges in the same house made an application to the p orochi al
committee for them to send the p orochi al surgeon to see a woman as was
very bad he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very
clever lad sent em some medicine in a blacking bottle offhand

ah theres promptness said the undertaker

promptness indeed replied the beadle but whats the consequence
whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir why the husband
sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and
so she shant take it says she shant take it sir good strong
wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish
labourers and a coal heaver only a week before sent em for nothing
with a black in bottle in and he sends back word that she shant take
it sir

as the atrocity presented itself to mr bumbles mind in full force he
struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with
indignation

well said the undertaker in ever did

never did sir ejaculated the beadle non or nobody never did but
now shes dead weve got to bury her and thats the direction and
the sooner its done the better

thus saying mr bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a
fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop

why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you
said mr sower berry looking after the beadle a she strode down the
street

yessir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of
sight during the interview and who was shaking from head to foot at
the mere recollection of the sound of mr bumbles voice

he need nt haven taken the trouble to shrink from mr bumbles glance
however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman
in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that
now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better
avoided until such time a she should be firmly bound for seven years
and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish
should be thus effectually and legally overcome

well said mr sower berry taking up his hat the sooner this job is
done the better noah look after the shop oliver put on your cap
and come with me oliver obeyed and followed his master on his
professional mission

they walked on for sometime through the most crowded and densely
inhabited part of the town and then striking down a narrow street
more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused
to look for the house which was the object of their search the houses
on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by
people of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have
sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the
squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies
half doubled occasionally skulked along a great many of the tenements
had shopfronts but these were fast closed and mouldering away only
the upper rooms being inhabited some houses which had become insecure
from age and decay were prevented from falling into the street by
huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly planted in the
road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the
nightly haunts of some house less wretches for many of the rough boards
which supplied the place of door and window were wrenched from their
positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human
body the kennel was stagnant and filthy the very rats which here and
the relay put re fying in its rottenness were hideous with famine

there was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open door where oliver
and his master stopped so groping his way cautiously through the dark
passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the
undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs stumbling
against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles

it was opened by a younggirl of thirteen or fourteen the undertaker
at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the
apartment to which he had been directed he stepped in oliver followed
him

there was no fire in the room but a man was crouching mechanically
over the empty stove an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the
cold hearth and was sitting beside him there were some ragged
children in another corner and in a small recess opposite the door
the relay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket
oliver shuddered a she cast his eyes toward the place and crept
involuntarily closer to his master for though it was covered up the
boy felt that it was a corpse

the mans face was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly
his eyes were bloodshot the old womans face was wrinkled her two
remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and here yes were bright
and piercing oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man they
seemed so like the rats he had seen outside

nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the
undertaker approached the recess keep back damn you keep back if
youve a life to lose

nonsense my goodman said the undertaker who was pretty well used
to misery in all its shapes nonsense

i tell you said the man clenching his hands and stamping furiously
on the floor i tell you i wont have her put into the ground she
couldnt rest there the worms would worry her not eather she is so
worn away

the undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape
from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body

ah said the man bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at
the feet of the dead woman kneel down kneel down kneel round her
everyone of you and mark my words i says he was starved to death i
never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her
bones were starting through the skin there was neither fire nor
candles he died in the dark in the dark she couldnt even see her
childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names i begged
for her in the streets and they sent me to prison when i came back
she was dying and all the blood inmyheart has dried up for they
starved her to death is wear it before the god that saw it they
starved her he twined his hands in his hair and with aloud scream
rolled grovelling upon the floor his eyes fixed and the foam covering
his lips

the terrified children cried bitterly but the old woman who had
hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that
passed menaced them into silence having un loosened the cravat of the
man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the
undertaker

she was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the
direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more
ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place lord lord
well it is strange that i who gave birth to her and was a woman
then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and
stiff lord lord to think of it its as good as a play as good as a
play

as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment
the undertaker turned to go away

stop stop said the old woman in aloud whisper will she be buried
tomorrow or next day or tonight i laid her out and i must walk
you know send me a large cloak a good warm one for it is bitter
cold we should have cake and wine too before we go nevermind send
some bread only a loaf of bread and a cup of water shall we have some
bread dear she said eagerly catching at the undertakers coat as
he once more moved towards the door

yes yes said the undertaker of course anything you like he
disengaged himself from the old womans grasp and drawing oliver
after him hurried away

the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
half quarter n loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by mr bumble
himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode where
mr bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the
workhouse who were to act as bearers an old black cloak had been
thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man and the bare coffin
having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers
and carried into the street

now you must put your best leg foremost old lady whispered
sower berry in the old woman sear we are rather late and it wont
do to keep the clergyman waiting move on my men as quick as you
like

thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden and the
two mourners kept as near them as they could mr bumble and
sower berry walked at a good smart pace in front and oliver whose legs
were not so long as his masters ran by the side

there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr sower berry had
anticipated however for when they reached the obscure corner of the
churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were
made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by
the vestry room fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it
might bean hour or so before he came so they put the bier on the
brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the
spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at
hide and seek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by
jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin mr sower berry and
bumble being personal friends of the clerks at by the fire with him
and read the paper

at length after a lapse of something more than an hour mr bumble
and sower berry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave
immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice
a she came along mr bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up
appearances and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his
surplice to the clerk and walked away again

now bill said sower berry to the gravedigger fill up

it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the
uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface the gravedigger
shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his feet
shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the boys who
murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon

come my goodfellow said bumble tapping the man on the back they
want to shutup the yard

the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the
graveside started raised his head stared at the person who had
addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a
swoon the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss
of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any
attention so they threw a can of coldwater over him and when he came
to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed
on their different ways

well oliver said sower berry as they walked home how do you like
it

pretty well thankyou sir replied oliver with considerable
hesitation not very much sir

ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sower berry nothing
when you are used to it my boy

oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very longtime
to get mr sower berry used to it but he thought it better not to ask
the question and walked back to the shop thinking overall he had
seen and heard




chapter vi
oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and
rather astonishes him


the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed it was a nice
sickly season just at this time in commercial phrase coffins were
looking up and in the course of a few weeks oliver acquired a great
deal of experience the success of mr sower berrys ingenious
speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes the oldest
inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful
processions which little oliver headed in a hat band reaching down to
his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town as oliver accompanied his master in most of his
adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a
finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the
beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded
people bear their trials and losses

for instance when sower berry had an order for the burial of some rich
old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews
and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous
illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most
public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need
be quite cheerful and contented conversing together with as much
freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb
them husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far
from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to
render it as becoming and attractive as possible it was observable
too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached
home and became quite composed before the tea drinking was overall
this was very pleasant and improving to see and oliver beheld it with
great admiration

that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
people i can not although i am his biographer undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence but i can most distinctly say that for
many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
ill treatment of noah clay pole who used him far worse than before now
that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
black stick and hat band while he the old one remained stationary in
the muffin cap and leathers charlotte treated him ill because noah
did and mrs sower berry was his decided enemy because mr sower berry
was disposed to be his friend so between these three on one side and
a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shutup by mistake in
the grain department of a brewery

and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history for i
have to record an acts light and unimportant perhaps in appearance
but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future
prospects and proceedings

one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinner hour to banquet upon a small joint of mutton a pound and a half
of the worst end of the neck when charlotte being called out of the
way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah clay pole being
hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a
worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist

intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the
tablecloth and pulled olivers hair and twitched his ears and
expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced
his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable
event should take place and entered upon various topics of petty
annoyance like a malicious and ill conditioned charity boy a she was
but making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still and
in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want
to be funny he got rather personal

work us said noah how s your mother

shes dead replied oliver dont you say anything about her to me

olivers colour rose a she said this he breathed quickly and there
was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which mr clay pole
thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying
under this impression he returned to the charge

what did she die of work us said noah

of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver
more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah i think i
know what it must be to die of that

told erol lol lol right foll airy work us said no a has a tear
rolled down olivers cheek whats set you a snivelling now

not you replied oliver sharply there thats enough dont say
anything more to me about her you d better not

better not exclaimed noah well better not work us dont be
impudent your mother too she was a nice un she was ohl or and
here noah nodded his head expressively and curled up as much of his
small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the
occasion

yer know work us continued noah emboldened by olivers silence
and speaking i najee ringtone of affected pity of all tones the most
annoying yer know work us it cant be helped now and of course yer
couldnt help it then and i am very sorry for it and im sure we all
are and pity yer very much but yer must know work us yer mother was
a regular right down bad un

what did you say inquired oliver looking up very quickly

a regular right down bad un work us replied noah coolly and
its a great deal better work us that she died when she did or else
shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung
which is more likely than either isnt it

crimson with fury oliver started up overthrew the chair and table
seized noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till
his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into
one heavy blow felled him to the ground

a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected
creature that harsh treatment had made him but his spirit was roused
at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire
his breast heaved his attitude was erect his eyebright and vivid
his whole person changed a she stood glaring over the cowardly
tormentor who now lay crouching a this feet and defied him with an
energy he had never known before

hell murder me blubbered noah charlotte miss is heres the new
boy a murdering of me helphelp olivers gone mad charlotte

noahs shouts were responded to by aloud scream from charlotte and a
louder from mrs sower berry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
by aside door while the latter paused on the staircase till she was
quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human
life to come further down

oh you little wretch screamed charlotte seizing oliver with her
utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strongman
in particularly good training oh you little ungrateful
murderous horrid villain and between every syllable charlotte
gave oliver a blow with all her might accompanying it with as cream
for the benefit of society

charlotte sfist was by no means a light one but lest it should not
be effectual in calming olivers wrath mrs sower berry plunged into
the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she
scratched his face with the other in this favourable position of
affairs noah rose from the ground and pommel led him behind

this was rather too violent exercise to last long when they were all
wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver
struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dust cellar and
there locked him up this being done mrs sower berry sunk into a
chair and burst into tears

bless her shes going off said charlotte a glass of water noah
dear make haste

oh charlotte said mrs sower berry speaking as well as she could
through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of coldwater which
noah had poured over her head and shoulders oh charlotte what a
mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds

ah mercy indeed ma am was the reply i only hope this ll teach
master not to have anymore of these dreadful creatures that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle poor noah he was
all but killed ma am when i come in

poor fellow said mrs sower berry looking piteously on the
charity boy

noah whose top waistcoat button might have been somewhere on a level
with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his
wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed
some affecting tears and sniffs

whats to be done exclaimed mrs sower berry your masters not at
home theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in
ten minutes olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
question rendered this occurance highly probable

dear dear i dont know ma am said charlotte unless we send for
the police officers

or the milling tary suggested mr clay pole

no no said mrs sower berry be thinking herself of oliver sold
friend run to mr bumble noah and tell him to come here directly
and not to lose a minute nevermind your cap make haste you can hold
a knife to that blackeye as you run along itll keep the swelling
down

noah stopped to make no reply but started off a this fullest speed
and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a
charity boy tearing through the street spell mell with no cap on his
head and a clasp knife a this eye




chapter vii
oliver continues refractory


noah clay pole ran along the streets a this swiftest pace and paused
not once for breath until he reached the workhouse gate having rested
here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an
imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and
presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that
even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of
times started back in astonishment

why whats the matter with the boy said the old pauper

mr bumble mr bumble cried noah with well affected dismay and in
tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of mr
bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much
that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat which is a very
curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a beadle
acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse maybe afflicted with a
momentary visitation of loss of self possession and forgetfulness of
personal dignity

oh mr bumble sir said noah oliver sir oliver has

what what interposed mr bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his
metallic eyes not runaway he hasnt runaway has he noah

no sir no not runaway sir but hes turned w icious replied
noah he tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder
charlotte and then miss is oh what dreadful pain it is such agony
please sir and here noah writhed and twisted his body into an
extensive variety o feel like positions thereby giving mr bumble to
understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of oliver twist
he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was
at that moment suffering the a cutest torture

when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed
mr bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his
dreadful wounds ten times louder than before and when he observed a
gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in
his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman
aforesaid

the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked
three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young
cur was howling for and why mr bumble did not favour him with
something which would render the series of v ocular exclamations so
designated an involuntary process

its a poorboy from the free school sir replied mr bumble who
has been nearly murdered all but murdered sir by young twist

by jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping
short i knew it i felt a strange presentiment from the very first
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung

he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said
mr bumble with a face of ashy paleness

and his miss is interposed mr clay pole

and his master too i think you said noah added mr bumble

no hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah he said
he wanted to

ah said he wanted to did he my boy inquired the gentleman in the
white waistcoat

yessir replied noah and please sir miss is wants to know
whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog
him cause masters out

certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about
three inches higher than his own your ea good boy a very good boy
here sa penny for you bumble just step up to sower berrys with your
cane and see whats best to be done dont spare him bumble

no i will not sir replied the beadle and the cocked hat and cane
having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction mr
bumble and noah clay pole be took themselves with all speed to the
undertakers shop

here the position of affairs had not at all improved sower berry had
not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished
vigour at the cellar door the accounts of his ferocity as related by
mrs sower berry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that mr
bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door with this
view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then
applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone

oliver

come you let me out replied oliver from the inside

do you know this here voice oliver said mr bumble

yes replied oliver

a int you afraid of its ira int you a trembling while is peak
sir said mr bumble

no replied oliver boldly

an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was
in the habit of receiving staggered mr bumble not a little he
stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and
looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute
astonishment

oh you know mr bumble he must be mad said mrs sower berry

no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you

its not madness ma am replied mr bumble after a few moments of
deep meditation its meat

what exclaimed mrs sower berry

meat ma am meat replied bumble with stern emphasis youve
overfed him ma am youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him
ma am unbecoming a person of his condition as the board mrs
sower berry who are practical philosophers will tell you what have
paupers to do with soul or spirit its quite enough that we let em
have live bodies if you had kept the boy on gruel ma am this would
never have happened

dear dear ejaculated mrs sower berry piously raising here yes to
the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal

the liberality of mrs sower berry to oliver had consisted of apr of use
bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else
would eat so there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in
her voluntarily remaining under mr bumbles heavy accusation of
which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or
deed

ah said mr bumble when the lady brought here yes down to earth
again the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to
leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hesa little starved
down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the
apprenticeship he comes of a bad family excitable natures mrs
sower berry both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his
made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed
any well disposed woman weeks before

at this point of mr bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced
kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible
sower berry returned at this juncture olivers offence having been
explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best
calculated to rouse his i re he unlocked the cellar door in a
twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar

olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face
was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead
the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled
out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite
un dismayed

now you area nice young fellow a int you said sower berry giving
oliver a shake and a box on the ear

he called my mother names replied oliver

well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs
sower berry she deserved what he said and worse

she didnt said oliver

she did said mrs sower berry

its a lie said oliver

mrs sower berry burst into a flood of tears

this flood of tears left mr sower berry no alternative if he had
hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be
quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been
according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a
brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of
a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital
within the limits of this chapter to do him justice he was as far as
his power went it was not very extensive kindly disposed towards the
boy perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because
his wife disliked him the flood of tears however left him no
resource so heat once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even mrs
sower berry herself and rendered mr bumbles subsequent application of
the parochial cane rather unnecessary for the rest of the day he was
shutup in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of
bread and at night mrs sower berry after making various remarks
outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his
mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of
noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed

it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings
which the days treatment maybe supposed likely to have awakened in a
mere child he had listened to their taunts with a look of contemp the
had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in
his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they
had roasted him alive but now when there were none to see or hear
him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his
hand swept such tears as godsend for the credit of our nature few
so young may ever have cause top our out before him

for along time oliver remained motionless in this attitude the
candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet having
gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the
fastenings of the door and looked abroad

it was a cold dark night the stars seemed to the boys eyes farther
from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind
and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground looked
sepulchral and death like from being so still he softly re closed the
door having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie
up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat
himself down upon a bench to wait for morning

with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
shutters oliver arose and again un barred the door one timid look
around one moments pause of hesitation he had closed it behind him
and was in the open street

he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly

he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up
the hill he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the
fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the
road struck into it and walked quickly on

along this same footpath oliver well remembered he had trotted beside
mr bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm
his waylay directly in front of the cottage his heartbeat quickly
when he be thought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back
he had come along way though and should lose a great deal of time by
doing so besides it was so early that there was very little fear of
his being seen so he walked on

he reached the house there was no appearance of its inmates stirring
at that early hour oliver stopped and peeped into the garden a child
was weeding one of the little beds a she stopped he raised his pale
face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions oliver
felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself
he had been his little friend and playmate they had been beaten and
starved and shutup together many and many a time

hush dick said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his
thin arm between the rails to greet him is anyone up

nobody but me replied the child

you mus nt say you saw me dick said oliveri am running away
they beat and ill use me dick and i am going to seek my fortune some
long way off i dont know where how pale you are

i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a
faint smile i am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont
stop

yes yes i will to say goodbye to you replied oliveri shall
see you again dick i know i shall you will be well and happy

i hope so replied the child after i am dead but not before i
know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of
heaven and angels and kind faces that in ever see when i am awake
kiss me said the child climbing up the low gate and flinging his
little arms round olivers neck goodbye dear god bless you

the blessing was from a young child slips but it was the first that
oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through the struggles
and sufferings and troubles and changes of his afterlife he never
once forgot it




chapter viii
oliver walks to london he encounters on the road a strange sort of
young gentleman


oliver reached the stile at which the by path terminated and once more
gained the high road it was eight oclock now though he was nearly
five miles away from the town her an and hid behind the hedges by
turn still noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken then
he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think
for the first time where he had better go and try to live

the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an
intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london the
name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind

london that great place nobody not even mr bumble could ever find
him there he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say
that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were ways of
living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country
parts had no idea of it was the very place for a homeless boy who
must die in the streets unless someone helped him as these things
passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked
forward

he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four
miles more before here collected how much he must undergo ere he could
hope to reach his place of destination as this consideration forced
itself upon him he slackened hi space a little and meditated upon his
means of getting there he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and
two pairs of stockings in his bundle he had a penny too a gift of
sower berrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more
than ordinarily well in his pocket a clean shirt thought oliver
is a very comfortable thing and so are two pairs of darned stockings
and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixty five miles walk
in wintertime but olivers thoughts like those of most other
people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his
difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular
purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and
trudged on

oliver walked twenty miles that day and all that time tasted nothing
but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he
begged at the cottage doors by the roadside when the night came he
turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hay rick determined
to lie there till morning he felt frightened at first for the wind
moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and
more alone than he had ever felt before being very tired with his
walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles

he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that
he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very
first village through which he passed he had walked no more than
twelve miles when night closed in again his feet were sore and his
legs so weak that they trembled beneath him another night passed in
the bleak damp air made him worse when he set forward on his journey
next morning he could hardly crawl along

he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and
then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took
any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the
top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a
halfpenny poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way
but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet when
the outside s saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets
again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve
anything and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
behind

in some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all
persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to
jail this frightened oliver very much and made him glad to get out of
those villages with all possible expedition in other she would stand
about the inn yards and look mournfully at everyone who passed a
proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady s ordering one of
the post boys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out of
the place for she was sure he had come to steal something if he
begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about
the beadle which brought olivers heart into his mouth very often the
only thing he had there for many hours together

in fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpike man and a
benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the
very same process which had put an end to his mothers in other words
he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kingshighway but
the turnpike man gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old lady
who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part
of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little
she could afford and more with such kind and gentle words and such
tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers
soul than all the suffering she had ever undergone

early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver
limped slowly into the little town of barnet the window shutters were
closed the street was empty not a soul had awakened to the business
of the day the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty but the
light only served to show the boy his own lonesome ness and desolation
ashes at with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep

by degrees the shutters were opened the windowblinds were drawn up
and people began passing to and fro some few stopped to gaze at oliver
for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried
by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he
came there he had no heart to beg and there he sat

he had been crouching on the step for sometime wondering at the great
number of public houses every other house in barnet was a tavern
large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed
through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with
ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and
determination beyond his years to accomplish when he was roused by
observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes
before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the
opposite side of the way he took little heed of this at first but the
boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that
oliver raised his head and returned his steady lookup on this the
boy crossed over and walking closeup to oliver said

hullo my covey whats the row

the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his
ownage but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even
seen he was a snub nosed flat browed common faced boy enough and as
dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see but he had about him all the
airs and manners of a man he was short of his age with rather
bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes his hat was stuck on the top of
his head so lightly that it threatened to falloff every moment and
would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of
every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which brought it
back to it sold place again he wore a mans coat which reached nearly
to his heels he had turned the cuffs back halfway up his arm to get
his hands out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of
thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers for there he
kept them he was altogether as royster ing and swaggering a young
gentleman as ever stood four feet six or something less in the
blucher s

hullo my covey whats the row said this strange young gentleman to
oliver

i am very hungry and tired replied oliver the tears standing in his
eyes a she spoke i have walked along way i have been walking these
seven days

walking for sivin days said the young gentleman oh i see beaks
order eh but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i
suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion

oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth
described by the term in question

my eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman why a beaks a
mad gst rate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight
for erd but always a going up and niver a coming down ag in was you
never on the mill

what mill inquired oliver

what mill why the mill the mill as takes up so little room that
itll work inside a stone jug and always goes better when the winds
low with people than when its high acos then they cant get workmen
but come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have
it i matlow watermark myself only one bob and a magpie but as far
as it goes ill fork out and stump up with you on your pins there
now then morrice

assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham
and a half quarter nlo a for a she himself expressed it a four penny
bran the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the
ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a
portion of the crumb and stuffing it there in taking the bread under
his arm the young gent l man turned into a small public house and led
the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises here a pot of beer
was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and oliver
falling to a this new friends bidding made along and hearty meal
during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time
with great attention

going to london said the strange boy when oliver had at length
concluded

yes

got any lodgings

no

money

no

the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as
the big coat sleeves would let them go

do you live in london inquired oliver

yes i do when im at home replied the boy i suppose you want
someplace to sleep in tonight dont you

i do indeed answered oliveri have not slept under a roof since i
left the country

dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman
ive got to be in london tonight and i know aspect able old
gentleman as lives there wot ll give you lodgings for no think and
never ask for the change that is if any genel man he knows inter duces
you and don the know me ohno not in the least by no means
certainly not

the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments
of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer a she did
so

this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted
especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the
old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a
comfortable place without loss of time this led to a more friendly
and confidential dialogue from which oliver discovered that his
friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and
protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned

mr dawkins appearance did not say avast deal in favour of the
comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took
under his protection but a she had a rather f lightly and dissolute
mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate
friends he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger
oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the
moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
him under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good
opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible and if he found
the dodger incorrigible a she more than half suspected he should to
decline the honour of his farther acquaintance

as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it
was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington
they crossed from the angel into st johns road struck down the small
street which terminates at sadler swells theatre through exmouth
street and coppice row down the little court by the side of the
workhouse across the classic ground which once bore the name of
hockley in the hole thence into little saffron hill and so into
saffron hill the great along which the dodgers cud de data rapid pace
directing oliver to follow close a this heels

although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glance so neither
side of the way a she passed along a dirtier or more wretched place
he had never seen the street was very narrow and muddy and the air
was impregnated with filthy odours

there were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade
appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were
crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside the
sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the
place were the public houses and in them the lowest orders of irish
were wrangling with might and main covered ways and yards which here
and there diverged from the mainstreet disclosed little knots of
houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth
and from several of the doorways great ill looking fellows were
cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very well disposed
or harmless errands

oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better runaway when
they reached the bottom of the hill his conductor catching him by the
arm pushed open the door of a house nearfield lane and drawing him
into the passage closed it behind them

now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the
dodger

plummy and slam was the reply

this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the
light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
passage andamans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the
old kitchen staircase had been broken away

theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out
and shielding his eyes with his hand whos the t other one

a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward

where did he come from

greenland is fagin upstairs

yes hesa sort in the wipes up with you the candle was drawn
back and the face disappeared

oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly
grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and
broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition
that showed he was well acquainted with them

he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him

the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and
dirt there was a deal table before the fire upon which were a candle
stuck in a ginger beer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and
butter and a plate in a fryingpan which was on the fire and which
was secured to the mantel shelf by a string some sausages were cooking
and standing over them with a toasting fork in his hand was a very
old shrivelled jew whose villainous looking and repulsive face was
obscured by a quantity of matted redhair he was dressed in a greasy
flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his
attention between the fryingpan and the clothes horse over which a
great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging several rough beds
made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor seated round
the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking
long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middle aged men
these all crowded about their associate a she whispered a few words to
the jew and then turned round and grinned at oliver so did the jew
himself toasting for kinh and

this is him fagin said jack dawkins my friend oliver twist

the jew grinned and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the
hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance
upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook
both his hands very hard especially the one in which he held his little
bundle one young gentleman was very anxious to hangup his cap for
him and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets in
order that a she was very tired he might not have the trouble of
emptying them himself when he went to bed these civilities would
probably be extended much farther but for a liberal exercise of the
jews toasting fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate
youths who offered them

wear every glad to see you oliver very said the jew dodger
takeoff the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for oliver ah
your east a ring at the pocket handkerchiefs eh my dear there area
good many of e maint there weve just looked em out ready for the
wash thats all oliver thats all hahaha

the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from
all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman in the midst of
which they went to supper

olive rate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot
g in and water telling him he must drink it off directly because
another gentleman wanted the tumbler oliver did a she was desired
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the
sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep




chapter ix
containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman
and his hopeful pupils


it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound longsleep
there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to
himself a she stirred it round and round with an iron spoon he would
stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below
and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and
stirring again as before

although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly
awake there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you
dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half
conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in
five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in
perfect unconsciousness at such time a mortal knows just enough of
what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its
mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space
when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate

oliver was precisely in this condition he saw the jew with his
half closed eyes heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepans sides and yet the selfsame
senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with
almost everybody he had ever known

when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob
standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he
did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at
oliver and called him by his name he did not answer and was to all
appearances asleep

after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the
door which he fastened he then drew forth as it seemed to oliver
from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on
the table his eyes glistened a she raised the lid and looked in
dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a
magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels

a has aid the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every
feature with a hideous grin clever dogs clever dogs staunch to the
last never told the old parson where they were never poached upon old
fagin and why should they it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept
the drop up a minute longer non on of in e fellows fine fellows

with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew
once more deposited the watch in its place of safety atleast half a
dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed
with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other
articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly
workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names

having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another so small that
it lay in the palm of his hand there seemed to be some very minute
inscription on it for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading
it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly at length he put
it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his chair
muttered

what a fine thing capital punishment is dead men never repent dead
men never bring awkward stories to light a hits a fine thing for the
trade five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or
turn white live red

as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been
staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face the boys eyes were
fixed on his in mute curiousity and although the recognition was only
for an instant for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceived it was enough to show the oldman that he had been observed

he closed the lid of the box with aloud crash and laying his hand on
a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up he trembled
very much though for even in his terror oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air

whats that said the jew what do you watch me for why are you
awake what have you seen speakout boy quick quick for your life

i was n table to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly i am
very sorry if i have disturbed you sir

you were not awake an hour ago said the jews cowling fiercely on
the boy

no no indeed replied oliver

are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer look than before
and a threatening attitude

upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly i was not
indeed sir

tush tush my dear said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner
and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to
induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport of course i
know that my dear i only tried to frighten you your ea brave boy
haha your ea brave boy oliver the jew rubbed his hands with a
chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding

did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the jew laying
his hand upon it after a short pause

yessir replied oliver

ah said the jew turning rather pale they they re mine oliver my
little property all i have to live upon in my old age the folks call
me a miser my dear only a miser thats all

oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps
his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of
money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he
might get up

certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman stay
theresa pitcher of water in the corner by the door bring i there
and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear

oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher when he turned his head the box was gone

he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying
the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when
the dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom
oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally
introduced to him as charley bates the four sat down to breakfast on
the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought
home in the crown of his hat

well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself
to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears

hard replied the dodger

as nails added charley bates

good boys good boys said the jew what have you got dodger

a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gent l man

lined inquired the jew with eagerness

pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks one
green and the other red

not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the
insides carefully but very neat and nicely made ingenious workman
a in the oliver

very indeed sir said oliver at which mr charles bates laughed
uproariously very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to
laugh at in anything that had passed

and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates

wipes replied masterbates at the same time producing four
pocket handkerchiefs

well said the jew inspecting them closely they re very good ones
very you havent marked them well though charley so the marks shall
be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it shall
us oliver eh hahaha

if you please sir said oliver

you d like to be able to make pocket handkerchiefs as easy as charley
bates wouldnt you my dear said the jew

very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver

masterbates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that
he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was
drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly
terminated in his premature suffocation

he is so jolly green said charley when here covered as an apology
to the company for his un polite behaviour

the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes
and said hed know better by and by upon which the old gentleman
observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking
whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning
this made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies
of the two boys that they had both been there and oliver naturally
wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
industrious

when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gent l man and the two
boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in
this way the merry old gentleman placing a snuff box in one pocket of
his trousers a note case in the other and a watch in his waistcoat
pocket with a guard chain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his
spectacle case and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the
room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walkabout the streets any hour in the day sometimes he stopped at the
fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was
staring with all his might into shop windows at such time she would
look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping
all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a
very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran
down his face all this time the two boys followed him closely about
getting out of his sight so nimbly everytime he turned round that
it was impossible to follow their motions at last the dodger trod
upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while charley bates
stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from
him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuff box note case
watchguard chain shirt pin pocket handkerchief even the
spectacle case if the old gent l man felt a hand in anyone of his
pocket she cried out where it was and then the game began all over
again

when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young
ladies called to see the young gentleman one of whom was named bet
and the other nancy they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly
turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings
they were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of
colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty being
remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them
very nice girls indeed as there is no doubt they were

the visitors stopped along time spirits were produced in consequence
of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside and
the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn at length
charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof
this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out for directly
afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went
away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with
money to spend

there my dear said fagin that sa pleasant life isnt it they
have gone out for the day

have they done work sir inquired oliver

yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come
across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do
my dear depend upon it make em your models my dear make em your
models tapping the fire shovel on the hearth to add force to his
words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all
matters especially the dodgers my dear hell be a great man himself
and will make you one too if you take pattern by him is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the jew stopping
short

yessir said oliver

see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do
when we were at play this morning

oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand a she had seen
the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with
the other

is it gone cried the jew

here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand

your ea clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting
oliver on the head approvingly in ever saw a sharper l adheres a
shilling for you if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man
of the time and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks
out of the handkerchiefs

oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to
do with his chances of being a great man but thinking that the jew
being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to
the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study




chapter x
oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new
associates and purchases experience at a high price being a short
but very important chapter in this history


for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out
of the pocket handkerchief of which a great number were brought
home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which
the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning at length
he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of
earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work
with his two companions

oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what
he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character
whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night empty handed
he would expat i ate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by
sending them supper less to bed on one occasion indeed he even went
so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was
carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent

at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so
eagerly sought there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two
or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre perhaps these
were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent but whether
they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the
joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger

the three boys sallied out the dodger with his coat sleeves tucked up
and his hat cocked as usual masterbates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets and oliver between them wondering where they
were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in
first

the pace at which they went was such a very lazy ill looking saunter
that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive
the old gentleman by not going to work at all the dodger had a
vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small
boys and tossing them down areas while charley bates exhibited some
very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering
divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and
thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that
they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction
these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring
his intention of seeking his wayback in the best way he could when
his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very
mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger

they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion
of terms the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying
his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the
greatest caution and circumspection

whats the matter demanded oliver

hush replied the dodger do you see that old cove at the
bookstall

the old gentleman over the way said oliver yes i see him

hell do said the dodger

a prime plant observed master charley bates

oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but he
was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman
towards whom his attention had been directed oliver walked a few paces
after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood
looking on in silent amazement

the old gentleman was a very respectable looking personage with a
powdered head and gold spectacles he was dressed in a bottle green
coat with a black velvet collar wore white trousers and carried a
smart bamboo cane under his arm he had taken up a book from the stall
and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his
elbow chair in his own study it is very possible that he fancied
himself there indeed for it was plain from his abstraction that he
saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short
anything but the book itself which he was reading straight through
turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at
the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest
interest and eagerness

what was olivers horror and alarm a she stood a few paces off looking
on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly goto see the
dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from
thence a handkerchief to see him hand the same to charley bates and
finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full
speed

in an instant the whole mystery of the hanker chiefs and the watches
and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind

he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his
veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then
confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he
did made off as fast a she could lay his feet to the ground

this was all done in a minutes space in the very instant when oliver
began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and
missing his handkerchief turned sharp round seeing the boy scudding
away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the
de predator and shouting stop thief with all his might made off
after him book in hand

but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
hue and cry the dodger and masterbates unwilling to attract public
attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the
very first doorway round the corner they no sooner heard the cry and
saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they
issued forthwith great promptitude and shouting stop thief too
joined in the pursuit like good citizens

although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not
theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that
self preservation is the first law of nature if he had been perhaps
he would have been prepared for this not being prepared however it
alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old
gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him

stop thief stop thief there is a magic in the sound the tradesman
leaves his counter and the carman his waggon the butcher throws down
his tray the baker his basket the milkman his pail the errand boy
his parcels the schoolboy his marbles the p avi our his pickaxe the
child his battle do re away they run pell mell helter skelter
slapdash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as
they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls
and streets squares and courts re echo with the sound

stop thief stop thief the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and
the crowd accumulate at every turning away they fly splashing through
the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the windows outrun
the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the
very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throngs well the
shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief stop thief

stop thief stop thief there is a passion for hunting something
deeply implanted in the human breast one wretched breathless child
panting with exhaustion terror in his looks agony in his eyes large
drops of perspiration streaming down his face strains every nerve to
make head upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain
upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy
stop thief ay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy

stopped at last a clever blow he is down upon the pavement and the
crowd eagerly gather round him each newcomer jostling and struggling
with the others to catch a glimpse stand aside give him a little
air nonsense he dont deserve it where s the gentleman here
his is coming down the street make room there for the gentleman
is this the boy sir yes

oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth
looking wildly roundup on the heap of faces that surrounded him when
the old gentleman was officious ly dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers

yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy

afraid murmured the crowd that sa good un

poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself

i did that sir said a great lubber ly fellow stepping forward
and preciously i cut my knuckle ag in his mouth i stopped him sir

the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his
pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of
dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away
himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and
thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is
generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made
his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar

come get up said the man roughly

it wasnt me indeed sir indeed indeed it was two other boys said
oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round they are
here somewhere

ohno they a int said the officer he meant this to be ironical
but it was true besides for the dodger and charley bates had filed off
down the first convenient court they came to

come get up

dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately

ohno i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half
off his back in proof there of come i know you it wont do will
you stand upon your legs you young devil

oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his
feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket collar at
a rapid pace the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side
and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead
and stared back at oliver from time to time the boys shouted in
triumph and on they went




chapter xi
treats of mr fang the police magistrate and furnishes as light
specimen of his mode of administering justice


the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the
immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two
or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led
beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of
summary justice by the back way it was a small paved yard into which
they turned and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand

whats the matter now said the man carelessly

a young fogle hunter replied the man who had oliver in charge

are you the party thats been robbed sir inquired the man with the
keys

yes i am replied the old gentleman but i am not sure that this
boy actually took the handkerchief ii would rather not press the
case

must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man his worship
will be disengaged in half a minute now young gallows

this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he
unlocked a she spoke and which led into a stone cell here he was
searched and nothing being found upon him locked up

this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not
so light it was most intolerably dirty for it was monday morning and
it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up
elsewhere since saturday night but this is little in our
station houses men and women are everynight confined on the most
trivial charges the word is worth noting in dungeons compared with
which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried
found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces let anyone who
doubts this compare the two

the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated
in the lock he turned with a sigh to the book which had been the
innocent cause of all this disturbance

there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to
himself a she walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of
the book in a thoughtful manner something that touches and interests
me can he be innocent he looked like bye the bye exclaimed the
old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky
bless my soul where have i seen something like that look before

after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same
meditative face into a back anteroom opening from the yard and there
retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye avast
amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many
years no said the old gentleman shaking his head it must be
imagination

he wandered over them again he had called them into view and it was
not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them there
were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost
strangers peering intrusively from the crowd there were the faces of
young and blooming girls that were now old women there were faces that
the grave had changed and closed upon but which the mind superior to
its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling
back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming
of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond
the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be
setup as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
heaven

but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers
features bore at race so he heaved a sigh over there collection she
awakened and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman
buried them again in the pages of the musty book

he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man
with the keys to follow him into the office he closed his book
hastily and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the
renowned mr fang

the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall mr fangs at
behind abarat the upper end and on one side the door was a sort of
wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited trembling
very much at the awfulness of the scene

mr fang was a lean long backed stiff necked middle sized man with
no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and
sides of his head his face was stern and much flushed if he were
really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good
for him he might have brought action against his countenance for
libel and have recovered heavy damages

the old gentleman bowed respectfully and advancing to the magistrates
desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and
address sir he then withdrew a pace or two and with another polite
and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned

now it so happened that mr fang was at that moment perusing a leading
article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent
decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth
time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state
for the home department he was out of temper and he looked up with an
angry scowl

who are you said mr fang

the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card

officer said mr fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the
newspaper who is this fellow

my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentleman
my names iris brownlow permit me to inquire the name of the
magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a
respectable person under the protection of the bench saying this
mrbrown low looked around the office as if in search of some person
who would afford him the required information

officer said mr fang throwing the paper on one side whats this
fellow charged with

hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer he
appears against this boy your worship

his worship knew this perfectly well but it was a good annoyance and
a safe one

appears against the boy does he said mr fang surveying mr
brownlow contemptuously from head to foot swear him

before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said mrbrown low
and that is that i really never without actual experience could
have believed

hold your tongue sir said mr fang peremptorily

i will not sir replied the old gentleman

hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the
office said mr fang your ean insolent impertinent fellow how
dare you bully a magistrate

what exclaimed the old gentleman reddening

swear this person said fang to the clerk ill not hear another
words wear him

mrbrown lows indignation was greatly roused but reflecting perhaps
that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to i the suppressed
his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once

now said fang whats the charge against this boy what have you
got to say sir

i was standing at a bookstall mrbrown low began

hold your tongue sir said mr fang policeman where s the
policeman here swear this policeman now policeman what is this

the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the
charge how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person
and how that was all he knew about it

are there any witnesses inquired mr fang

none your worship replied the policeman

mr fangs at silent for some minutes and then turning round to the
prosecutor said in a towering passion

do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is manor
do you not you have been sworn now if you stand there refusing to
give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench i will
by

by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jail or coughed
very loud just at the right moment and the former dropped a heavy
book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being
heard accidently of course

with many interruptions and repeated insults mrbrown low contrived
to state his case observing that in the surprise of the moment he
had run after the boy because he had saw him running away and
expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him
although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he
would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow

he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion and
i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bari
really fear that he is ill

oh yes i daresay said mr fang with a sneer come none of your
tricks here you young vagabond they wont do whats your name

oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him he was deadly pale
and the whole place seemed turning round and round

whats your name you hardened scoundrel demanded mr fang
officer whats his name

this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who
was standing by the bar he bent over oliver and repeated the inquiry
but finding him really incapable of understanding the question and
knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the
more and add to the severity of his sentence he hazarded a guess

he says his names tom white your worship said the kindhearted
thief taker

oh he wont speakout won the said fang very well very well
where does he live

where he can your worship replied the officer again pretending to
receive olivers answer

has he any parents inquired mr fang

he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer
hazard ing the usual reply

at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head and looking
round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
water

stuff and nonsense said mr fang dont try to make a fool of me

i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer

i know better said mr fang

take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands
instinctively hell fall down

stand away officer cried fang let him if he likes

oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in
a fainting fit the men in the office looked at each other but no one
dared to stir

i knew he was s hamming said fan gas if this were incontestable
proof of the fact let him lie there hell soon be tired of that

how do you propose to deal with the case sir inquired the clerk in
a low voice

summarily replied mr fang he stands committed for three
months hard labour of course clear the office

the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were
preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell when an elderly man
of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed
hastily into the office and advanced towards the bench

stop stop dont take him away for heavens sake stop a moment
cried the newcomer breathless with haste

although the presiding genii in such an office as this exercise a
summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good name the
character almost the lives of her majestys subjects especially of
the poorer class and although within such walls enough fantastic
tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping they are
closed to the public save through the medium of the daily
press footnote or were virtually the nmr fang was consequently
not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such
irreverent disorder

what is this who is this turn this man out clear the office cried
mr fang

i will speak cried the man i will not be turned out i saw it
all i keep the bookstall i demand to be sworn i will not be put
down mr fang you must hear me you must not refuse sir

the man was right his manner was determined and the matter was
growing rather too serious to be hushed up

swear the man growled mr fang with a very ill grace now man
what have you got to say

this said the man i saw three boys two others and the prisoner
here loitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman
was reading the robbery was committed by another boy i saw it done
and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and st up ified by it
having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy bookstall
keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact
circumstances of the robbery

why didnt you come here before said fang after a pause

i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man everybody who
could have helped me had joined in the pursuit i could get nobody
till five minutes ago and ive run here all the way

the prosecutor was reading was he inquired fang after another
pause

yes replied the man the very book he has in his hand

oh that book eh said fang is it paid for

no it is not replied the man with a smile

dear me i forgot all about it exclaimed the absent old gentleman
innocently

a nice person to prefer a charge against a poorboy said fang with
a comical effort to look humane i consider sir that you have
obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and
disreputable circumstances and you may think yourself very fortunate
that the owner of the property declines to prosecute let this be a
lesson to you my manor the law will overtake you yet the boy is
discharged clear the office

dn me cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had
kept down so long dn me ill

clear the office said the magistrate officers do you hear clear
the office

the mandate was obeyed and the indignant mrbrown low was conveyed
out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other in a
perfect ph renz y of rage and defiance he reached the yard and his
passion vanished in a moment little oliver twist lay on his back on
the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with
water his face a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his whole
frame

poorboy poorboy said mrbrown low bending over him call a
coach somebody pray directly

a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on the
seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other

may i accompany you said the bookstall keeper looking in

bless me yes my dear sir said mrbrown low quickly i forgot you
dear dear i have this unhappy book still jump in poor fellow
theres no time to lose

the bookstall keeper got into the coach and away they drove




chapter xii
in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before and in
which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful
friends


the coach rattled away over nearly the same ground as that which
oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the
dodger and turning a different way when it reached the angel at
islington stopped at length before an eat house in a quiet shady
street near pentonville here a bed was prepared without loss of
time in which mrbrown low saw his young charge carefully and
comfortably deposited and here he was tended with a kindness and
solicitude that knew no bounds

but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of
his new friends the sun rose and sank and rose and sank again and
many times after that and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy
bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever the worm
does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow
creeping fire upon the living frame

weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have
been along and troubled dream feebly raising himself in the bed with
his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously around

what room is this where have i been brought to said oliver this
is not the place i went to sleep in

he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak
but they were overheard at once the curtain at the beds head was
hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely
dressed rose as she un drew it from an armchair close by in which
she had been sitting at needlework

hush my dear said the old lady softly you must be very quiet or
you will be ill again and you have been very bad as bad as bad could
be pretty nigh lie down again theresa dear with those words the
old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow and
smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving
in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand in
hers and drawing it round his neck

save us said the old lady with tears in here yes what a grateful
little dear it is pretty cree tur what would his mother feel if she
had sat by him as i have and could see him now

perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands
together perhaps she has sat by me i almost feel as if she had

that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly

i suppose it was replied oliver because heaven is along way off
and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor
boy but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there
for she was very ill herself before she died she cant know anything
about me though added oliver after a moments silence if she had
seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful and her face has always
looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her

the old lady made no reply to this but wiping here yes first and her
spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were
part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver
to drink and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very
quiet or he would be ill again

so oliver kept very still partly because he was anxious to obey the
kind old lady in all things and partly to tell the truth because he
was completely exhausted with what he had already said he soon fell
into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a
candle which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with
a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his hand who felt his
pulse and said he was a great deal better

you area great deal better are you not my dear said the
gentleman

yes thankyou sir replied oliver

yes i know you are said the gentleman you re hungry too ant
you

no sir answered oliver

hem said the gentleman no i know you reno the is not hungry
mrs bed win said the gentleman looking very wise

the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to
say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man the doctor
appeared much of the same opinion himself

you feel sleepy dont you my dear said the doctor

no sir replied oliver

no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look you re
not sleepy nor thirsty are you

yessir rather thirsty answered oliver

just as i expected mrs bed win said the doctor its very natural
that he should be thirsty you may give him a little team a am and
some dry toast without any butter dont keep him too warm ma am but
be careful that you dont let him be too cold will you have the
goodness

the old lady dropped a curtsey the doctor after tasting the cool
stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away his
boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner a she went
downstairs

oliver dozed off again soon after this when he awoke it was nearly
twelve oclock the old lady tenderly bade him goodnight shortly
afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just
come bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayerbook and a
large nightcap putting the latter on her head and the former on the
table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up
with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series
of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumbling s
forward and divers moans and choking s these however had no worse
effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep
again

and thus the night crept slowly on oliver lay awake for sometime
counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
rush light shade threw upon the ceiling or tracing with his languid
eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall the darkness and
the deep stillness of the room were very solemn as they brought into
the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many
days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his
awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently
prayed to heaven

gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
suffering alone imparts that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain
to wake from who if this were death would be roused again to all the
struggles and turmoils of life to all its cares for the present its
anxieties for the future more than all its weary recollections of the
past

it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes he felt
cheerful and happy the crisis of the disease was safely pas the
belonged to the world again

in three days time he was able to sit in an easy chair well propped
up with pillows and a she was still too weak to walk mrs bed win had
him carried downstairs into the little housekeepers room which
belonged to her having him set hereby the fireside the good old
lady sat herself down too and being in a state of considerable
delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most
violently

nevermind me my dear said the old lady im only having a regular
good cry there its all over now and im quite comfortable

your every very kind to mem a am said oliver

well never you mind that my dear said the old lady thats got
nothing to do with your broth and its full time you had it for the
doctor says mrbrown low may come into see you this morning and we
must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell
be pleased and with this the old lady applied herself to warming up
in a little saucepan a basin full of broth strong enough oliver
thought to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation
strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest
computation

are you fond of pictures dear inquired the old lady seeing that
oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung
against the wall just opposite his chair

i dont quite know ma am said oliver without taking his eyes from
the canvas i have seen so few that i hardly know what a beautiful
mild face that ladys is

ah said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than
they are or they wouldnt get any custom child the man that invented
the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
succeed its a deal too honest a deal said the old lady laughing
very heartily at her own acuteness

is is that a likeness ma am said oliver

yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth
that sa portrait

whose ma am asked oliver

why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a
good humoured manner its not a likeness of anybody that you or i
know i expect it seems to strike your fancy dear

it is so pretty replied oliver

why sure you re not afraid of it said the old lady observing in
great surprise the look of a we with which the child regarded the
painting

ohno no returned oliver quickly but the eyes look so sorrowful
and where is it they seem fixed upon me it makes my heartbeat
added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak
to me but couldnt

lord save us exclaimed the old lady starting dont talk in that
way child you re weak and nervous after your illness let me wheel
your chair round to the other side and then you wont see it there
said the old lady suiting the action to the word you dont see it
now at all events

oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not
altered his position but he thought it better not to worry the kind
old lady so he smiled gently when she looked at him and mrs bed win
satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of
toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
preparation oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition he
had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came as of trap at
the door come in said the old lady and in walked mrbrown low

now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be but he had no
sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands
behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long look at
oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
contortions oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and
made an ineffectual attempt to standup out of respect to his
benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again
and the fact is if the truth must be told that mrbrown lows heart
being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic
process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a
condition to explain

poorboy poorboy said mrbrown low clearing his throat im
rather hoarse this morning mrs bed win im afraid i have caught
cold

i hope not sir said mrs bed win everything you have had has been
well aired sir

i dont know bed win i dont know said mrbrown low i rather
think i had a damp napkin at dinnertime yesterday but nevermind
that how do you feel my dear

very happy sir replied oliver and very grateful indeed sir for
your goodness to me

good by said mrbrown low stoutly have you given him any
nourishment bed win any slops eh

he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied mrs
bed win drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the
last word to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded
there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever

ugh said mrbrown low with as light shudder a couple of glasses
of port wine would have done him a great deal more good wouldnt they
tom white eh

my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid with a look of
great astonishment

oliver said mrbrown low oliver what oliver white eh

no sir twist oliver twist

queer name said the old gentleman what made you tell the
magistrate your name was white

in ever told him so sir returned oliver in amazement

this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in olivers face it was impossible to doubt him
there was truth in everyone of its thin and sharpened lineaments

some mistake said mrbrown low but although his motive for looking
steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the resemblance
between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly
that he could not withdraw his gaze

i hope you are not angry with me sir said oliver raising his eyes
beseeching ly

no no replied the old gentleman why whats this bed win look
there

a she spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over olivers head and
then to the boys face there was its living copy the eyes the head
the mouth every feature was the same the expression was for the
instant so precisely a like that the minutes t line seemed copied with
startling accuracy

oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation for not being
strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away a
weakness on his part which affords the narrative an opportunity of
relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils
of the merry old gentleman and of recording

that when the dodger and his accomplished friend masterbates joined
in the hue and cry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence
of their executing an illegal conveyance of mrbrown lows personal
property as has been already described they were actuated by a very
laudable and becoming regard for themselves and forasmuch as the
freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the
first and proudest boasts of a true hearted englishman so i need
hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt
them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great
a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own
preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code
of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid
down as the main springs of all natures deeds and actions the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to
matters of maxim and theory and by a very neat and pretty compliment
to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight
any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling for
these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by
universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and
weaknesses of her sex

if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of
the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate
predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a
foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when
the general attention was fixed upon oliver and making immediately for
their home by the shortest possible cut although i do not mean to
assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages
to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being
rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocution sand
discursive staggering s like unto those in which drunken men under the
pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge still i
do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the in variable
practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories
to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every
possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect
themselves thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong and
you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify the
amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the
distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher
concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive
and impartial view of his own particular case

it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through
a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured
to halt beneath a low and dark archway having remained silent here
just long enough to recover breath to speak masterbates uttered an
exclamation of amusement and delight and bursting into an
uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and
rolled there on in a transport of mirth

whats the matter inquired the dodger

hahaha roared charley bates

hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round
do you want to be grabbed stupid

icant help it said charley icant help it to see him splitting
away at that pace and cutting round the corners and knocking up
again the posts and starting on again as if he was made of iron as
well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out arter
him oh my eye the vivid imagination of masterbates presented the
scene before him in too strong colours a she arrived at this
apostrophe he again rolled upon the doorstep and laughed louder than
before

what ll fagin say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next
interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the
question

what repeated charley bates

ah what said the dodger

why what should he say inquired charley stopping rather suddenly
in his merriment for the dodgers manner was impressive what should
he say

mr dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes then taking off his hat
scratched his head and nodded thrice

what do you mean said charley

to or rullo l loo gammon and spin n age the frog he wouldnt and high
cock olor um said the dodger with as light sneer on his intellectual
countenance

this was explanatory but not satisfactory masterbates felt it so
and again said what do you mean

the dodger made no reply but putting his hat on again and gathering
the skirts of his long tailed coat under his arm thrust his tongue
into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen times in
a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down
the court masterbates followed with a thoughtful countenance

the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the
occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman a she
sat over the fire with a save loy and a small loaf in his hand a
pocketknife in his right and a pewter pot on the trivet there was a
rascally smile on his whiteface a she turned round and looking
sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows ben this ear towards the
door and listened

why how s this muttered the jew changing countenance only two of
em where s the third they cant have got into trouble hark

the footsteps approached nearer they reached the landing the door was
slowly opened and the dodger and charley bates entered closing it
behind them




chapter xiii
some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader
connected with whom various pleasant matters are related appertaining
to this history


where so liver said the jew rising with a menacing look where s
the boy

the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed a this
violence and looked uneasily at each other but they made no reply

whats become of the boy said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by
the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations speakout
or ill throttle you

mr fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who
deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who
conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be
throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised aloud
well sustained and continuous roar something between a mad bull and a
speaking trumpet

will you speak thundered the jew shaking the dodgers o much that
his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous

why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the
dodger sullenly come let goo me will you and swinging
himself at one jerk cleanout of the big coat which he left in the
jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass
at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat which if it had taken effect
would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily
replaced

the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude and
seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it a this assailants head but
charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full
at that young gentleman

why what the blazes is in the wind now growled a deep voice who
pitched that ere at me its well its the beer and not the pot as
hit me or id have settled somebody i might have know das nobody
but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to
throwaway any drink but water and not that unless he done the river
company every quarter wots it all about fagin dme if my
neck hand kercher ant lined with beer come in you sneaking war mint
wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master
come in

the man who growled out these words was a stoutly built fellow of
about five and thirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab
breeches lace up half boots and grey cotton stockings which in closed
a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calves the kind of legs
which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete
state without a set of fetters to garnish them he had a brown hat on
his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck with the
long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face a she
spoke he disclosed when he had done so abroad heavy countenance
with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes one of which
displayed various part i coloured symptoms of having been recently
damaged by a blow

come in dye hear growled this engaging ruffian

a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty
different places skulked into the room

why didnt you come in aforesaid the man you re getting too proud
to own me afore company are you lie down

this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the
other end of the room he appeared well used to it however for he
coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound
and winking his very ill looking eyes twenty times in a minute
appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment

what are you up to ill treating the boys you covetous avaricious
insatiable old fence said the man seating himself deliberately
i wonder they dont murder you i would if i was the mifid been
your prentice id have done it long ago and no i couldnt have sold
you afterwards for you refit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity
of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow glass
bottles large enough

hush hush mr sikes said the jew trembling dont speak so
loud

none of your mister ing replied the ruffian you always mean
mischief when you come that you know my name out with it is hant
disgrace it when the time comes

well well then bill sikes said the jew with abject humility you
seem out of humour bill

perhaps i am replied sikes i should think you was rather out of
sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
about as you do when you blab and

are you mad said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and
pointing towards the boys

mr sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left
ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb
show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly he then in cant
terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully be sprinkled
but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here
demanded a glass of liquor

and mind you dont poison it said mr sikes laying his hat upon the
table

this was said in jest but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
with which the jew bit his pale lipa she turned round to the cupboard
he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish
at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far
from the old gentlemans merry heart

after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits mr sikes
condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen which gracious
act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers
capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and
improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable
under the circumstances

im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get
us into trouble

thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin you re
blowed upon fagin

and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not
noticed the interruption and regarding the other closely a she did
so im afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with a
good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than it
would for me my dear

the man started and turned roundup on the jew but the old gentlemans
shoulders were shrugged up to his ears and his eyes were vacantly
staring on the opposite wall

there was along pause every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his own reflections not excepting the dog who by
a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter
in the streets when he went out

somebody must find out wots been done at the office said mr sikes
in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in

the jew nodded assent

if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes
out again said mr sikes and then he must be taken care on you
must get hold of him somehow

again the jew nodded

the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious but
unfortunately there was on every strong objection to its being
adopted this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and
mr william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and
deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or
pretext whatever

how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to
guess it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject however
for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver had seen on
a former occasion caused the conversation to flow a fresh

th everything said the jew bet will go wont you my dear

where s inquired the young lady

only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxing ly

it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm
that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and
earnest desire to be blessed if she would a polite and delicate
evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been
possessed of that natural good breeding which can not bear to inflict
upon a fellow creature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal

the jews countenance fell he turned from this young lady who was
gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and
yellow curl papers to the other female

nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you
say

that it wont do so its no use a trying it on fagin replied
nancy

what do you mean by that said mr sikes looking up in a surly
manner

what i say bill replied the lady collected ly

why you re just the very person for it reasoned mr sikes nobody
about here knows anything of you

and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same
composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill

shell go fagin said sikes

no she wont fagin said nancy

yes she will fagin said sikes

and mr sikes was right by dint of alternate threats promises and
bribes the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
the commission she was not indeed withheld by the same
considerations as her agreeable friend for having recently removed
into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb
of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being
recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances

accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her
curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnet both articles of dress
being provided from the jews inexhaustible stock miss nancy prepared
to issue forth on here rr and

stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered
basket carry that in one hand it looks more respectable my dear

give her a door key to carry in her t other one fagin said sikes
it looks real and geni vine like

yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large
street door key on the forefinger of the young ladys righthand

there very good very good indeed my dear said the jew rubbing
his hands

oh my brother my poor dear sweet innocent little brother
exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket
and the street door key in an agony of distress what has become of
him where have they taken him to oh do have pity and tell me whats
been done with the dear boy gentlemen do gentlemen if you please
gentlemen

having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heartbroken tone
to the immeasurable delight of her hearers miss nancy paused winked
to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared

ah she sa clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his
young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition
to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld

she sa honour to her sex said mr sikes filling his glass and
smiting the table with his enormous fist heres her health and
wishing they was all like her

while these and many other encomium s were being passed on the
accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the
police office whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity
consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she
arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards

entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the
cell doors and listened there was no sound within so she coughed and
listened again still there was no reply so she spoke

no lly dear murmured nancy in a gentle voice no lly

there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been
taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society
having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by mr
fang to the house of correction for one month with the appropriate and
amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be
more wholesome ly expended on the treadmill than in a musical
instrument he made no answer being occupied mentally bewailing the
loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the
county so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there

well cried a faint and feeble voice

is there a little boy here inquired nancy with a preliminary sob

no replied the voice god forbid

this was a vagrant of sixty five who was going to prison for not
playing the flute or in other words for begging in the streets and
doing nothing for his livelihood in the next cell was another man who
was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license
thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the
stamp office

but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or
knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in
the striped waistcoat and with the most piteous wailing sand
lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of
the street door key and the little basket demanded her own dear
brother

i havent got him my dear said the oldman

where is he screamed nancy in a distracted manner

why the gentlemans got him replied the officer

what gentleman oh gracious heavens what gentleman exclaimed
nancy

in reply to this incoherent questioning the oldman informed the
deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office
and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to
have been committed by another boy not in custody and that the
prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own
residence of and concerning which all the informant knew was that it
was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in
the directions to the coachman

in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman
staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a
swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could
think of to the domicile of the jew

mr bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered
than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat
expeditiously departed without devoting anytime to the formality of
wishing the company goodmorning

we must know where he is my dear she must be found said the jew
greatly excited charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring
home some news of him nancy my dear i must have him found i trust
to you my dear to you and the artful for everything stay stay
added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand theres money
my dears i shall shutup this shop tonight youll know where to find
me dont stop here a minute not an instant my dears

with these words he pushed them from the room and carefully
double locking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of
concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver
then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
his clothing

a rap at the door startled him in this occupation whos there he
cried in a shrill tone

me replied the voice of the dodger through the keyhole

what now cried the jew impatiently

is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says inquired the
dodger

yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him find him find
him out that salli shall know what to do next never fear

the boy murmured a reply of intelligence and hurried downstairs after
his companions

he has not peached so far said the je was he pursued his occupation
if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his mouth
yet




chapter xiv
comprising further particulars of olivers stay at mrbrown lows with
the remarkable prediction which one mr grim wig uttered concerning him
when he went out on an errand


oliver soon recovering from the fainting fit into which mrbrown lows
abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was
carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and mrs bed win in the
conversation that ensued which indeed bore no reference to olivers
history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might am use
without exciting him he was still too weak to get up to breakfast
but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first
act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again
looking on the face of the beautiful lady his expectations were
disappointed however for the picture had been removed

ah said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes
it is gone you see

i see it is ma am replied oliver why have they taken it away

it has been taken down child because mrbrown low said that as it
seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you
know rejoined the old lady

ohno indeed it didnt worry mem a am said oliveri liked to
see it i quite loved it

well well said the old lady good humour edly you get well as fast
as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again there i promise
you that now let us talkabout something else

this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at
that time as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he
endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then so he listened
attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and
handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome
man and lived in the country and about as on who was clerk to a
merchant in the west indies and who was also such a good youngman
and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year that it brought
the tears into here yes to talkabout them when the old lady had
expat i ated along time on the excellences of her children and the
merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone
poor dear soul just six and twenty years it was time to have tea
after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage which he learnt as
quickly as she could teach and at which game they played with great
interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some
warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and then to go cos ily
to bed

they were happy days those of olivers recovery everything was so
quiet and neat and orderly everybody so kind and gentle that after
the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it
seemed like heaven itself he was no sooner strong enough to put his
clothes on properly than mrbrown low caused a complete new suit and
a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him as oliver
was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave
them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell
them to a jew and keep the money for herself this she very readily
did and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew
roll them up in his bag and walkaway he felt quite delighted to think
that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger
of his ever being able to wear them again they were sa drags to tell
the truth and oliver had never had a new suit before

one evening about a week after the affair of the picture a she was
sitting talking to mrs bed win there came a message down from mr
brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see
him in his study and talk to him a little while

bless us and save us wash your hands and let me part your hair
nicely for you child said mrs bed win dear heart alive if we had
known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean collar
on and made you as smart as sixpence

oliver did as the old lady bade him and although she lamented
grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little
frill that bordered his shirt collar he looked so delicate and
handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so
far as to say looking at him with great complacency from head to foot
that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the
longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better

thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door on mrbrown low
calling to him to come in he found himself in a little backroom
quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little
gardens there was a table drawn up before the window at which mr
brownlow was seated reading when he saw oliver he pushed the book
away from him and told him to come near the table and sitdown
oliver complied marvelling where the people could be found to read
such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
wiser which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver
twist everyday of their lives

there area good many books are there not my boy said mr
brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the
shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling

a great number sir replied oliver in ever saw so many

you shall read them if you be have well said the old gentleman
kindly and you will like that better than looking at the
outside s that is some cases because there are books of which the
backs and covers are by far the best parts

i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to
some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding

not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head
and smiling a she did so there are other equally heavy ones though
of a much smaller size how should you like to grow up a clever man
and write books eh

i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver

what wouldnt you like to be a book writer said the old gentleman

oliver considered a little while and at last said he should think it
would be a much better thing to be a bookseller upon which the old
gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing
which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it
was

well well said the old gentleman composing his features dont be
afraid we wont make an author of you while there san honest trade
to be learnt or brick making to turn to

thankyou sir said oliver at the earnest manner of his reply the
old gentleman laughed again and said something about a curious
instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention
to

now said mrbrown low speaking if possible in a kinder but at the
same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever known him
assume yeti want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am
going to say i shall talk to you without any reserve because i am
sure you are well able to understand me as many older persons would
be

oh dont tell you are going to send me away sir pray exclaimed
oliver alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentlemans
commencement dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
again let me stay here and be a servant dont send me back to the
wretched place i came from have mercy upon a poorboy sir

my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of
olivers sudden appeal you need not be afraid of my deserting you
unless you give me cause

in ever never will sir interposed oliver

i hope not rejoined the old gentleman i do not think you ever
will i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have
endeavoured to benefit but i feel strongly disposed to trust you
nevertheless and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well
account for even to myself the persons on whom i have bestowed my
dearest love lie deep in their graves but although the happiness and
delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my
heart and sealed it up forever on my best affections deep
affliction has but strengthened and refined them

as the old gentleman said this in a low voice more to himself than to
his companion and a she remained silent for a short time afterwards
oliver sat quite still

well well said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful
tone i only say this because you have a young heart and knowing
that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful
perhaps not to wound me again you say you are an orphan without a
friend in the world all the inquiries i have be enable to make
confirm the statement let me hear your story where you come from who
brought you up and how you got into the company in which i found you
speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live

olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes when he was on
the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the
farm and carried to the workhouse by mr bumble a peculiarly
impatient little double knock was heard at the street door and the
servant running upstairs announced mr grim wig

is he coming up inquired mrbrown low

yessir replied the servant he asked if there were any muffins in
the house and when it old him yes he said he had come to tea

mrbrown low smiled and turning to oliver said that mr grim wig was
an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in
his manners for he was a worthy creature at bottom a she had reason
to know

shall i go downstairs sir inquired oliver

no replied mrbrown low i would rather you remained here

at this moment there walked into the room supporting himself by a
thick stick a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was
dressed in a bluecoat striped waistcoat nan keen breeches and
gaiters and abroad brimmed white hat with the sides turned up with
green a very small plaited shirt frills tuck out from his waistcoat
and a very long steel watch chain with nothing but a key at the end
dangled loosely below it the ends of his white neckerchief were
twisted into a ball about the size of an orange the variety of shapes
into which his countenance was twisted defy description he had a
manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke and of looking
out of the corners of his eyes at the same time which irresistibly
reminded the beholder of a parrot in this attitude he fixed himself
the moment he made his appearance and holding out a small piece of
orange peel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented
voice

look here do you see this isnt it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that icant call at a mans house but i find a
piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase ive been lamed
with orange peel once and i know orange peel will be my death or ill
be content to eat my own head sir

this was the handsome offer with which mr grim wig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he made and it was the more singular in his
case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility
of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
a gentleman to ea this own head in the event of his being so disposed
mr grim wigs head was such a particularly large one that the most
sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sitting to put entirely out of the question a very
thick coating of powder

ill eat my head sir repeated mr grim wig striking his stick upon
the ground hallo whats that looking at oliver and retreating a
pace or two

this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said mr
brownlow

oliver bowed

you dont mean to say thats the boy who had the fever i hope said
mr grim wig recoiling a little more wait a minute dont speak
stop continued mr grim wig abruptly losing all dread of the fever
in his triumph at the discovery thats the boy who had the orange if
thats not the boy sir who had the orange and threw this bit of peel
upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too

no no he has not had one said mrbrown low laughing come put
down your hat and speak to my young friend

i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old
gentleman drawing off his gloves theres always more or less
orange peel on the pavement in our street and i know its put there
by the surgeons boy at the corner a young woman stumbled over abit
last night and fell against my garden railings directly she got up i
saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime light
dont goto him i called out of the window he san assassin a
man trap so he is if he is not here the irascible old gentleman
gave a great knock on the ground with his stick which was always
understood by his friends to imply the customary offer whenever it
was not expressed in words then still keeping his stick in his hand
he sat down and opening a double eyeglass which he wore attached to
abroad black rib and took a view of oliver who seeing that he was
the object of inspection coloured and bowed again

thats the boy is it said mr grim wig at length

thats the boy replied mrbrown low

how are you boy said mr grim wig

a great deal better thankyou sir replied oliver

mrbrown low seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about
to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step downstairs and tell
mrs bed win they were ready for tea which a she did not half like the
visitors manner he was very happy to do

he is a nice looking boy is he not inquired mrbrown low

i dont know replied mr grim wig pettis hly

dont know

no i dont know in ever see any difference in boys i only knew two
sort of boys mealy boys and be effaced boys

and which is oliver

mealy i know a friend who has a be effaced boy a fine boy they call
him with around head and red cheeks and glaring eyes a horrid boy
with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of
his blue clothes with the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a
wolf i know him the wretch

come said mrbrown low these are not the characteristics of young
oliver twist so he need nt excite your wrath

they are not replied mr grim wig he may have worse

here mrbrown low coughed impatiently which appeared to afford mr
grim wig the most exquisite delight

he may have worse i say repeated mr grim wig where does he come
from who is he what is hehe has had a fever what of that fevers
are not peculiar to good people are they bad people have fevers
sometimes havent the yeh i knew a man who was hung in jamaica for
murdering his master he had had a fever six time she wasnt
recommended to mercy on that account pooh nonsense

now the fact was that in the in most recesses of his own heart mr
grim wig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and
manner were unusually pre possessing but he had a strong appetite for
contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
orange peel and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to
him whether a boy was well looking or no the had resolved from the
first to oppose his friend when mrbrown low admitted that on no one
point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer and that he
had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he
thought the boy was strong enough to hear it mr grim wig chuckled
maliciously and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper was
in the habit of counting the plate at night because if she didnt find
a tablespoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would be
content to and so forth

all this mrbrown low although himself somewhat of an impetuous
gentleman knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good
humour as mr grim wig at tea was graciously pleased to express his
entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly and
oliver who made one of the party began to feel more a this ease than
he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence

and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of
the life and adventures of oliver twist asked grim wig of mr
brownlow at the conclusion of the meal looking sideways at oliver as
he resumed his subject

tomorrow morning replied mrbrown low i would rather he was alone
with meat the time come up to me tomorrow morning atten oclock my
dear

yessir replied oliver he answered with some hesitation because
he was confused by mr grim wigs looking so hard at him

ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to mrbrown low he
wont come up to you tomorrow morning i saw him hesitate he is
deceiving you my good friend

ill swear he is not replied mrbrown low warmly

if he is not said mr grim wi gill and down went the stick

ill answer for that boys truth with my life said mrbrown low
knocking the table

and i for his falsehood with my head rejoined mr grim wig knocking
the table also

we shall see said mrbrown low checking his rising anger

we will replied mr grim wig with a provoking smile we will

as fate would have it mrs bed win chanced to bring in at this moment
a small parcel of books which mrbrown low had that morning purchased
of the identical bookstall keeper who has already figured in this
history having laid the mon the table she prepared to leave the room

stop the boy mrs bed win said mrbrown low there is something to
go back

he has gone sir replied mrs bed win

call after him said mrbrown low its particular he is a poor
man and they are not paid for there are some books to be taken back
too

the street door was opened oliver ran one way and the girl ran
another and mrs bed win stood on the step and screamed for the boy
but there was no boy insight oliver and the girl returned in a
breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him

dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed mrbrown low i
particularly wished those books to be returned tonight

send oliver with them said mr grim wig with an ironical smile he
will be sure to deliver them safely you know

yes do let me take them if you please sir said oliver ill run
all the way sir

the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out
on any account when a most malicious cough from mr grim wig determined
him that he should and that by his prompt discharge of the
commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions on
this head atleast at once

you shall go my dear said the old gentleman the books are on a
chair by my table fetch them down

oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his armin
a great bustle and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to
take

you are to say said mrbrown low glancing steadily at grim wig you
are to say that you have brought those books back and that you have
come to pay the four pound ten i owe him this is a five pound note so
you will have to bring me back ten shillings change

i wont be ten minutes sir said oliver eagerly having buttoned up
the banknote in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully
under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room mrs bed win
followed him to the street door giving him many directions about the
nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of the
street all of which oliver said he clearly understood having
super added many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old lady
at length permitted him to depart

bless his sweet face said the old lady looking after him icant
bear somehow to let him go out of my sight

at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned
the corner the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and
closing the door went back to her own room

let me see hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said mr
brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table it will
be dark by that time

oh you really expect him to comeback do you inquired mr grim wig

dont you asked mrbrown low smiling

the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr grim wigs breast at the
moment and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile

no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not the boy has
a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his
armand a five pound note in his pocket hell join his old friends
the thieves and laugh at you if ever that boy returns to this house
sir ill eat my head

with these words he drew his chair closer to the table and there the
two friends satin silent expectation with the watch between them

it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our
own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
hasty conclusions that although mr grim wig was not by any means a
bad hearted man and though he would have been unfeigned ly sorry to see
his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly
and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come
back

it grew so dark that the figures on the dial plate were scarcely
discernible but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in
silence with the watch between them




chapter xv
showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy
were


in the obscure parlour of a low public house in the filthiest part of
little saffron hill a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight
burnt all day in the wintertime and where no ray of sun ever shone in
the summer there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a
small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquorama nina
velveteen coat drab shorts half boots and stockings whom even by
that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated
to recognise as mr william sikes a this feet sata white coated
red eyed dog who occupied himself alternately in winking a this
master with both eyes at the same time and in licking a large fresh
cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some
recent conflict

keep quiet you war mint keep quiet said mr sikes suddenly
breaking silence whether his meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought
upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable
from kicking an un offending animal to allay them is matter for
argument and consideration whatever was the cause the effect was a
kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously

dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
their masters but mr sikes s dog having faults of temper in common
with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a
powerful sense of injury made no more a do but at once fixed his teeth
in one of the half boots having given in a hearty shake he retired
growling under a form just escaping the pewter measure which mr
sikes levelled a this head

you would would you said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and
deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife which he drew
from his pocket come here you born devil come here dye hear

the dog no doubt heard because mr sikes spoke in the very harshest
key of a very harsh voice but appearing to entertain some
unaccountable objection to having his throat cu the remained where he
was and growled more fiercely than before at the same time grasping
the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild
beast

this resistance only infuriated mr sikes the more who dropping on
his knees began to assail the animal most furiously the dog jumped
from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and
barking the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the
struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other when the
door suddenly opening the dog darted out leaving bill sikes with the
poker and the clasp knife in his hands

there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage mr
sikes being disappointed of the dogs participation at once
transferred his share in the quarrel to the newcomer

what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for said sikes
with a fierce gesture

i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humbly for the
jew was the newcomer

didnt know you white live red thief growled sikes couldnt you
hear the noise

not a sound of it a sima living man bill replied the jew

ohno you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce
sneer sneaking in and out so as nobody hear show you come or go i
wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago

why inquired the jew with a forced smile

cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as
havent half the pluck of curs lets a man killa dog how he likes
replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look
thats why

the jew rubbed his hands and sitting down at the table affected to
laugh at the pleasantry of his friend he was obviously very ill at
ease however

grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with
savage contempt grin away youll never have the laugh at me though
unless its behind a nightcap ive got the upper handover you fagin
and dme ill keep it there if i go you go so take care of me

well well my dear said the jew i know all that we we have a
mutual interest bill a mutual interest

humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
the jews side than on his well what have you got to say to me

its all passed safe through the melting pot replied fagin and
this is your share its rather more than it ought to be my dear but
as i know youll dome a good turn another time and

stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently where is it
handover

yes yes bill give me time give me time replied the jew
soothingly here it is all safe a she spoke he drew for than old
cotton handkerchief from his breast and untying a large knot in one
corner produced a small brown paper packet sikes snatching it from
him hastily opened it and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
contained

this is all is it inquired sikes

all replied the jew

you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along have you inquired sikes suspiciously dont put on an
injured look at the question youve done it many a time jerk the
tinkler

these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell
it was answered by another jew younger than fagin but nearly as vile
and repulsive in appearance

bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure the jew perfectly
understanding the hint retired to fill it previously exchanging a
remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if
in expectation of it and shook his head in reply so slightly that the
action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
person it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie
the boot lace which the dog had torn possibly if he had observed the
brief interchange of signal she might have thought that it boded no
good to him

is anybody here barney inquired fagin speaking now that that
sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground

dot a shoul replied barney whose words whether they came from the
heart or not made their way through the nose

nobody inquired fagin in at one of surprise which perhaps might
mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth

do body but biss dads y replied barney

nancy exclaimed sikes where strike me blind if i dont honour
that ere girl for her native talents

she sbi dhavid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney

send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor send her
here

barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission the jew remaining
silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired and
presently returned ushering in nancy who was decorated with the
bonnet apron basket and street door key complete

you are on the scent are you nancy inquired sikes proffering the
glass

yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents
and tired enough of it i am too the young brats been ill and
confined to the crib and

ah nancy dear said fagin looking up

now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eyebrows and a
half closing of his deeply set eyes warned miss nancy that she was
disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance
the fact is all we need care for here and the fact is that she
suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon mr
sikes turned the conversation to other matters in about ten minutes
time mr fagin was seized with a fit of coughing upon which nancy
pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go
mr sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself
expressed his intention of accompanying her they went away together
followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a backyard
as soon as his master was out of sight

the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it
looked after him a she walked up the dark passages hook his clenched
fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin reseated
himself at the table where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the hue and cry

meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very
short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the
bookstall when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a
by street which was not exactly in his way but not discovering his
mistake until he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in
the right direction he did not think it worthwhile to turn back and
so marched on as quickly a she could with the books under his arm

he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to
feel and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick
who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment
when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud oh my
dear brother and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter was
when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his
neck

dont cried oliver struggling let go of me who is it what are
you stopping me for

the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from
the young woman who had embraced him and who had a little basket and a
street door key in her hand

oh my gracious said the young woman i have found him oh oliver
oliver oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your
account come home dear come oh ive found him thank gracious
goodness heav in sive found him with these incoherent exclamations
the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully
hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was
also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the
doctor to which the butchers boy who appeared of a lounging not to
say indolent disposition replied that he thought not

ohno no nevermind said the young woman grasping olivers hand
im better now come home directly you cruel boy come

ohm a am replied the young woman her an away near a month ago
from his parents who are hardworking and respectable people and went
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his
mothers heart

young wretch said one woman

go home do you little brute said the other

i am not replied oliver greatly alarmed i dont know her i
havent any sister or father and mother either i man orphan i live
at pentonville

only hear him how he braves it out cried the young woman

why its nancy exclaimed oliver who now saw her face for the first
time and started back in irrepressible astonishment

you see he knows me cried nancy appealing to the bystanders he
cant help himself make him come home theres good people or hell
kill his dear mother and father and break my heart

what the devils this said a man bursting out of a beer shop with
a white dog a this heels young oliver come home to your poor mother
you young dog come home directly

i dont belong to them i dont know them helphelp cried oliver
struggling in the mans powerful grasp

help repeated the man yes ill help you you young rascal what
books are these youve been a stealing em have you give em here
with these words the man to re the volumes from his grasp and struck
him on the head

thats right cried a looker on from a garret window thats the
only way of bringing him to his senses

to be sure cried a sleepy faced carpenter casting an approving look
at the garret window

itll do him good said the two women

and he shall have it too rejoined the man administering another
blow and seizing oliver by the collar come on you young villain
here bullseye mind him boy mind him

weak with recent illness st up ified by the blows and the suddenness of
the attack terrified by the fierce growling of the dog and the
brutality of the man overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders
that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be
what could one poor child do darkness had set in it was a low
neighborhood no help was near resistance was useless in another
moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was
forced along the mata pace which rendered the few cries he dared to
give utterance to unintelligible it was of little moment indeed
whether they were intelligible or no for there was nobody to care for
them had they been ever so plain


the gas lamps were lighted mrs bed win was waiting anxiously at the
open door the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if
there were any traces of oliver and still the two old gentlemen sat
persevering lyin the dark parlour with the watch between them




chapter xvi
relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy


the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open
space scattered about which were pens for beasts and other
indications of a cattle market sikes slackened hi space when they
reached this spot the girl being quite unable to support any longer
the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked turning to oliver he
roughly commanded him to take hold of nancy sh and

do you hear growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round

they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers

oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail he
held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers

give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand
here bullseye

the dog looked up and growled

see here boy said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat
if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him dye mind

the dog growled again and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were
anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay

he sas willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt said
sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval
now you know what youve got to expect master so callaway as quick
as you like the dog will soon stop that game get on young un

bullseye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
endearing form of speech and giving vent to another ad monitory growl
for the benefit of oliver led the way onward

it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been
grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary the night
was dark and foggy the lights in the shops could scare cely struggle
through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the
streets and houses in gloom rendering the strange place still stranger
in olivers eyes and making his uncertainty the more dismal and
depressing

they had hurried on a few paces when a deep church bell struck the
hour with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned
their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded

eight oclock bill said nancy when the bell ceased

whats the good of telling me that i can hear it c anti replied
sikes

i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy

of course they can replied sikes it was bartle my time when i was
shopped and there war nt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt
hear the squeaking on arter i was locked up for the night the row and
d in outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could almost
have beat my brains out against their on plates of the door

poor fellow said nancy who still had her face turned towards the
quarter in which the bell had sounded oh bill such fine young chaps
as them

yes thats all you women think of answered sikes fine young
chaps well they re as good as dead so it dont much matter

with this consolation mr sikes appeared to repress arising tendency
to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step
out again

wait a minute said the girl i wouldnt hurry by if it was you
that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck
bill id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow
was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me

and what good would that do inquired the unsentimental mr sikes
unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
rope you might as well be walking fifty mile of for not walking at
all for all the good it would dome come on and dont stand
preaching there

the girl burst into a laugh drew her shawl more closely round her and
they walked away but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in
her face as they passed a gaslamp saw that it had turned a deadly
white

they walked on by little frequented and dirty ways for a full
half hour meeting very few people and those appearing from their
looks to hold much the same position in society as mr sikes himself
at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of
old clothes shops the dog running forward as if conscious that there
was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the
door of a shop that was closed and apparently un tenanted the house was
in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed aboard intimating
that it was to let which looked as if it had hung there for many
years

all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about

nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell
they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few
moments under a lamp a noise as if as ash window were gently raised
was heard and soon afterwards the door softly opened mr sikes then
seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony and
all three were quickly inside the house

the passage was perfectly dark they waited while the person who had
let them in chained and barred the door

anybody here inquired sikes

no replied a voice which oliver though the had heard before

is the old un here asked the robber

yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been
won the be glad to see you ohno

the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it
seemed familiar to oliver sears but it was impossible to distinguish
even the form of the speaker in the darkness

lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or
treading on the dog look after your legs if you do

standstill a moment and ill get you one replied the voice the
receding footsteps of the speaker were heard and in another minute
the form of mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared he
bore in his righthand at allow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
stick

the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin but turning away
beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs they
crossed an empty kitchen and opening the door of a low
earthy smelling room which seemed to have been built in a small
backyard were received with a shout of laughter

oh my wig my wig cried master charles bates from whose lungs the
laughter had proceeded here he is oh cry here he is oh fagin
look at him fagin do look at him icant bear it it is such a jolly
game icant bear it hold me somebody while i laugh it out

with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth masterbates laid himself
flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an
ect as y of facetious joy then jumping to his fee the snatched the
cleft stick from the dodger and advancing to oliver viewed him round
and round while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number
of low bows to the bewildered boy the artful meantime who was of a
rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it
interfered with business rifled olivers pockets with steady
assiduity

look a this to gs fagin said charley putting the light so close to
his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire look a this to gs
superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut oh my eye what a game and
his books too nothing but a gentleman fagin

delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing
with mock humility the artful shall give you another suit my dear
for fear you should spoil that sunday one why didnt you write my
dear and say you were coming wed have got something warm for
supper

a this masterbates roared again so loud that fagin himself relaxed
and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the five pound
note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
awakened his merriment

hallo whats that inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew
seized the note thats mine fagin

no no my dear said the jew mine bill mine you shall have the
books

if that a int mine said bill sikes putting on his hat with a
determined airmine and nancy s that is ill take the boy back
again

the jew started oliver started too though from a very different
cause for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being
taken back

come handover will you said sikes

this is hardly fair bill hardly fair is it nancy inquired the
jew

fair or not fair retorted sikes handover i tell you do you
think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time
but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every youngboy as
gets grabbed through you give i there you avaricious old skeleton
give i there

with this gentle remonstrance mr sikes plucked the note from between
the jews finger and thumb and looking the oldman coolly in the face
folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief

thats for our share of the trouble said sikes and not half
enough neither you may keep the books if you re fond of reading if
you a int sell em

they re very pretty said charley bates who with sundry grimaces
had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question beautiful
writing isnt is oliver at sight of the dismayed look with which
oliver regarded his tormentors masterbates who was blessed with a
lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ect as y more
boisterous than the first

they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his hands
to the goodkind old gentleman who took me into his house and had
me nursed when i was near dying of the fever oh pray send them back
send him back the books and money keep me here all my lifelong but
pray pray send them back hell think is to lethem the old lady all
of them who were so kind to me will think is to lethem oh do have
mercy upon me and send them back

with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet and be a this hands
together in perfect desperation

the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting
his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot you re right oliver you re
right they will think you have stolen em haha chuckled the
jew rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had
chosen our time

of course it couldnt replied sikes i know d that directly i see
him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm its all
right enough they re soft hearted psalm singers or they wouldnt have
taken him in at all and theyll ask no questions after him fear they
should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged hes safe
enough

oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being
spoken as if he were bewildered and could scare cely understand what
passed but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet
and to re wildly from the room uttering shrieks for help which made
the bare old house echo to the roof

keep back the dog bill cried nancy springing before the door and
closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit keep
back the dog hell tear the boy to pieces

serve him right cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from
the girls grasp standoff from me or ill split your head against
the wall

i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the
girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first

shan the said sikes setting his teeth ill soon do that if you
dont keep off

the house breaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the
room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among
them

whats the matter here said fagin looking round

the girls gone madi think replied sikes savagely

no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle
no she hasnt fagin dont think it

then keep quiet will you said the jew with a threatening look

no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud
come what do you think of that

mr fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel
tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
conversation with her at present with the view of diverting the
attention of the company he turned to oliver

so you wanted to getaway my dear did you said the jew taking up
a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace eh

oliver made no reply but he watched the jews motions and breathed
quickly

wanted to get assistance called for the police did you sneered the
jew catching the boy by the arm well cure you of that my young
master

the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club and
was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it
from his hands he flung it into the fire with a force that brought
some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room

i wont standby and see it done fagin cried the girl youve got
the boy and what more would you have let him be let him be or i shall
put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before
my time

the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this
threat and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked
alternately at the jew and the other robber her face quite colourless
from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself

why nancy said the jew in a soothing tone after a pause during
which he and mr sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
manner you you re more clever than ever tonight haha my dear
you are acting beautifully

am i said the girl take care i dont over do it you will be the
worse for it fagin if i do and so i tell you in good time to keep
clear of me

there is something about aroused woman especially if she add to all
her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and
despair which few men like to provoke the jew saw that it would be
hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss
nancy s rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a
glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes as if to hint that
he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue

mr sikes thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal
pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy
to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and
threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the
fertility of his invention as they produced no visible effect on the
object against whom they were discharged however here sorted to more
tangible arguments

what do you mean by this said sikes backing the inquiry with a very
common im pre cation concerning the most beautiful of human features
which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand
times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a
disorder as measles what do you mean by it burn my body do you know
who you are and what you are

oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing
hysterically and shaking her head from side to side with a poor
assumption of indifference

well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was
accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a
good longtime to come

the girl laughed again even less composedly than before and darting
a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the
blood came

your ea nice one added sikes a she surveyed her with a
contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side a pretty
subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of

god almighty help me i am cried the girl passionately and i wish
i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them
we passed so near tonight before i had lenta hand in bringing him
here hesa thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night
for this nt that enough for the old wretch without blows

come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in are monst ratory
tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all
that passed we must have civil words civil words bill

civil words cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see
civil words you villain yes you deserve em from me i thieve d for
you when i was a child not half as old as this pointing to oliveri
have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve years
since dont you know it speakout dont you know it

well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification and
if you have its your living

aye it is returned the girl not speaking but pouring out the
words in one continuous and vehement scream it is my living and the
cold wet dirty streets are my home and you re the wretch that drove
me to them long ago and that ll keep me there day and night day and
night till i die

i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these
reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more

the girl said nothing more but tearing her hair and dress in a
transport of passion made such a rush at the je was would probably
have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been
seized by sikes at the right moment upon which she made a few
ineffectual struggles and fainted

shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner shes
uncommon strong in the arms when she sup in this way

the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have
the disturbance over but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the
boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
incidental to business

its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing
his club but they re clever and we cant get on in our line
without em charley show oliver to bed

i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had
he inquired charley bates

certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which
charley put the question

masterbates apparently much delighted with his commission took the
cleft stick and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were
two or three of the beds on which he had slept before and here with
many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old
suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon
leaving off at mrbrown lows and the accidental display of which to
fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue
received of his where about

put off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to
take care of what fun it is

poor oliver unwillingly complied masterbates rolling up the new
clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the
dark and locking the door behind him

the noise of charley slaughter and the voice of miss betsy who
opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other
feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept
many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which
oliver was placed but he was sick and weary and he soon fell sound
asleep




chapter xvii
olivers destiny continuing un propitious brings a great man to london
to injure his reputation


it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to
present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as
the layers of red and white in aside of streaky bacon the hero sinks
upon his straw bed weighed down by fetters and misfortunes in the
next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience
with a comic song we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in the
grasp of a proud and ruthless baron her virtue and her life a like in
danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the
other and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest
pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the
great hall of the castle where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny
chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of allsorts of
places from church vaults to palaces and roamabout in company
ca rolling perpetually

such changes appear absurd but they are not so unnatural as they would
seem at first sight the transitions in real life from well spread
boards to death beds and from mourning weeds to holiday garments are
not a whit less startling only there we are busy actors instead of
passive lookers on which makes avast difference the actors in the
mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt
impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the eyes of
mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous

as sudden shifting s of the scene and rapid changes of time and place
are not only sanctioned in books by long usage but are by many
considered as the great art of authorship an authors skill in his
craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the
dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter
this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed
unnecessary if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the
part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver
twist was born the reader taking it for granted that there are good
and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be
invited to proceed upon such an expedition

mr bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse gate and walked
with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street he was
in the full bloom and pride of beadle hood his cocked hat and coat were
dazzling in the morning sun he clutched his cane with the vigorous
tenacity of health and power mr bumble always carried his head high
but this morning it was higher than usual there was an abstraction in
his eye an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for
utterance

mr bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and
others who spoke to him deferentially a she passed along he merely
returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in
his dignified pace until he reached the farm where mrs mann tended
the infant paupers with parochial care

dr at that beadle said mrs mann hearing the well known shaking at
the garden gate if it isnt him at this time in the morning la uk
mr bumble only think of its being you well dear me it is a
pleasure this is come into the parlour sir please

the first sentence was addressed to susan and the exclamations of
delight were uttered to mr bumble as the good lady unlocked the
garden gate and showed him with great attention and respect into the
house

mrs mann said mr bumble not sitting upon or dropping himself
into a seat as any common jack an apes would but letting himself
gradually and slowly down into a chair mrs mann ma am good
morning

well and goodmorning to you sir replied mrs mann with many
smiles and hoping you find yourself well sir

so so mrs mann replied the bead leap orochi al life is not a bed
of roses mrs mann

ah that it isnt indeed mr bumble rejoined the lady and all the
infant paupers might have chorus sed the rejoinder with great propriety
if they had heard it

ap orochi all i fema am continued mr bumble striking the table
with his can eisa life of worr it and vexation and hardihood but
all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution

mrs mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her
hands with a look of sympathy and sighed

ah you may well sigh mrs mann said the beadle

findings he had done right mrs mann sighed again evidently to the
satisfaction of the public character who repressing a complacent
smile by looking sternly a this cocked hat said

mrs manni am going to london

la uk mr bumble cried mrs mann starting back

to london ma am resumed the inflexible beadle by coach i and two
paupers mrs manna legal action is a coming on about a settlement
and the board has appointed meme mrs mann to dispose to the matter
before the quarter sessions at clerk in well

and i very much question added mr bumble drawing himself up
whether the clerk in well sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
box before they have done with me

oh you must nt be too hard upon them sir said mrs mann
coaxing ly

the clerk in well sessions have brought it upon themselves ma am
replied mr bumble and if the clerk in well sessions find that they
come off rather worse than they expected the clerk in well sessions have
only themselves to thank

there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
manner in which mr bumble delivered himself of these words that mrs
mann appeared quite a wed by them at length she said

you re going by coach siri thought it was always usual to send them
paupers in carts

thats when they re ill mrs mann said the beadle we put the sick
paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their taking
cold

oh said mrs mann

the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap
said mr bumble they are both in a very low state and we find it
would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury em that is if
we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to
do if they dont die upon the road to spite us hahaha

when mr bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered
the cocked hat and he became grave

we are forgetting business ma am said the beadle here is your
p orochi al stipend for the month

mr bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his
pocketbook and requested a receipt which mrs mann wrote

its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants but its
formal enough i daresay thankyou mr bumble siri am very much
obliged to you im sure

mr bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of mrs manns curtsey
and inquired how the children were

bless their dear little hearts said mrs mann with emotion they re
as well as can be the dears of course except the two that died last
week and little dick

isnt that boy no better inquired mr bumble

mrs mann shook her head

he sail l conditioned w icious bad disposed p orochi al child that
said mr bumble angrily where is he

ill bring him to you in one minutes ir replied mrs mann here
you dick

after some calling dick was discovered having had his face put under
the pump and dried upon mrs manns gown he was led into the awful
presence of mr bumble the beadle

the child was pale and thin his cheeks were sunken and his eyes large
and bright the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung
loosely on his feeble body and his young limbs had wasted away like
those of an oldman

such was the little being who stood trembling beneath mr bumbles
glance not daring to lift his eyes from the floor and dreading even
to hear the beadles voice

cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy said mrs mann

the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of mr bumble

whats the matter with you p orochi al dick inquired mr bumble with
well timed jocularity

nothing sir replied the child faintly

i should think not said mrs mann who had of course laughed very
much at mr bumbles humour

you want for nothing im sure

i should like faltered the child

heyday interposed mrs manni suppose you re going to say that
you do want for something now why you little wretch

stop mrs mann stop said the beadle raising his hand with a show
of authority like what sire h

i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would
put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and
seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground

why what does the boy mean exclaimed mr bumble on whom the
earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression
accustomed a she was to such things what do you mean sir

i should like said the child to leave my dearlove to poor oliver
twist and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to
think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help
him and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small
hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to
die when i was very young for perhaps if i had lived to beaman
and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me
or be unlike me and it would be so much happier if we were both
children there together

mr bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with
indescribable astonishment and turning to his companion said
they re all in one story mrs mann that out da cious oliver had
demo g alized them all

i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands
and looking malignant ly at dick in ever see such a hardened little
wretch

take him away ma am said mr bumble imperiously this must be
stated to the board mrs mann

i hope the gentleman will understand that it isnt my fault sir
said mrs mann whimpering pathetically

they shall understand that ma am they shall be acquainted with the
true state of the case said mr bumble there take him away i
cant bear the sight on him

dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coal cellar mr
bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey

at six oclock next morning mr bumble having exchanged his cocked
hat for around one and encased his person in a blue greatcoat with a
cape to it took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by
the criminals whose settlement was disputed with whom in due course
of time he arrived in london

he experienced no other crosses on the way than those which originated
in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in
shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which mr bumble
declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel
quite uncomfortable although he had a greatcoat on

having disposed of these evil minded persons for the night mr bumble
sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped and took a
temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter putting a glass
of hot g in and water on the chimney piece he drew his chair to the
fire and with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of
discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper

the very first paragraph upon which mr bumbles eye rested was the
following advertisement

five guineas reward


whereas a youngboy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on
thursday evening last from his home at pentonville and has not since
been heard of the above reward will be paid to any person who will
give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver
twistor tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which
the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested

and then followed a full description of olivers dress person
appearance and disappearance with the name and address of mr
brownlow at full length

mr bumble opened his eyes read the advertisement slowly and
carefully three several times and in something more than five minutes
was on his way to pentonville having actually in his excitement left
the glass of hot g in and water un tasted

is mrbrown low at home inquired mr bumble of the girl who opened
the door

to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive
reply of i dont know where do you come from

mr bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his
errand than mrs bed win who had been listening at the parlour door
hastened into the passage in a breathless state

come income in said the old lady i knew we should hear of him
poor dear i knew we should i was certain of it bless his heart i
said so all along

having heard this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
again and seating herself on as of a burst into tears the girl who
was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile and now
returned with a request that mr bumble would follow her immediately
which he did

he was shown into the little back study where sat mrbrown low and his
friend mr grim wig with decanters and glasses before them the latter
gentleman at once burst into the exclamation

a beadle a parish beadle or ill eat my head

pray dont interrupt just now said mrbrown low take a seat will
you

mr bumbles at himself down quite confounded by the oddity of mr
grim wigs manner mrbrown low moved the lamp so as to obtain an
uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance and said with a little
impatience

now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement

yessir said mr bumble

and you area beadle are you not inquired mr grim wig

i a map orochi al beadle gentlemen rejoined mr bumble proudly

of course observed mr grim wig aside to his friend i knew he was
a beadle all over

mrbrown low gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and
resumed

do you know where this poorboy is now

no more than nobody replied mr bumble

well what do you know of him inquired the old gentleman speak
out my friend if you have anything to say what do you know of
him

you dont happen to know any good of him do you said mr grim wig
caustically after an attentive perusal of mr bumbles features

mr bumble catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his head with
portentous solemnity

you see said mr grim wig looking triumphantly at mrbrown low

mrbrown low looked apprehensively at mr bumbles pursed up
countenance and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding
oliver in as few words as possible

mr bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms
inclined his head in a retrospective manner and after a few moments
reflection commenced his story

it would be tedious if given in the beadles words occupying as it
did some twenty minutes in the telling but the sum and substance of
it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents
that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than
treachery ingratitude and malice that he had terminated his brief
career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly
attack on an un offending lad and running away in the nighttime from
his masters house in proof of his really being the person he
represented himself mr bumble laid upon the table the paper she had
brought to town folding his arms again he then awaited mrbrown lows
observations

i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after
looking over the papers this is not much for your intelligence but i
would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been favourable
to the boy

it is not improbable that if mr bumble had been possessed of this
information at an earlier period of the interview he might have
imparted a very different colouring to his little history it was too
late to do it now however so he shook his head gravely and
pocketing the five guineas withdrew

mrbrown low paced the room to and fro for some minutes evidently so
much disturbed by the beadles tale that even mr grim wig for bore to
vex him further

at length he stopped and rang the bell violently

mrs bed win said mrbrown low when the housekeeper appeared that
boy oliver is an imposter

it cant be sir it can not be said the old lady energetically

i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman what do you mean by
cant be we have just heard a full account of him from his birth and
he has been a thorough paced little villain all his life

in ever will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly never

you old women never believe anything but quack doctors and lying
storybooks growled mr grim wig i knew it all along why didnt you
take my advise in the beginning you would if he hadnt had a fever i
suppose eh he was interesting was n the interesting bah and mr
grim wig poked the fire with a flourish

he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted mrs bed win
indignantly i know what children are sir and have done these forty
years and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about
them thats my opinion

this was a hard hit at mr grim wig who was a bachelor as it extorted
nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head
and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was
stopped by mrbrown low

silence said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from
feeling never let me hear the boys name again i rang to tell you
that never never on any pretence mind you may leave the room mrs
bed win remember i am in earnest

there were sad hearts at mrbrown lows that night

olivers heart sank within him when he thought of his good friends it
was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it
might have broken outright




chapter xviii
how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable
friends


about noon next day when the dodger and masterbates had gone out to
pursue their customary avocations mr fagin took the opportunity of
reading oliver along lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of
which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary
extent in wilfully absent ing himself from the society of his anxious
friends and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so
much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery mr fagin
laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and
cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished
with hunger and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young
lad whom in his philanthropy he had succour ed under parallel
circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing
a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be
hanged at the old bailey one morning mr fagin did not seek to conceal
his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his eyes that
the wrongheaded and treacherous behaviour of the young person in
question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of
certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true
was indispensably necessary for the safety of him mr fagin and a few
select friends mr fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable
picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and
politeness of manner expressed his anxious hopes that he might never
be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation

little olivers blood ran cold a she listened to the jews words and
imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them that it was
possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the
guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already and
that deeply laid plans for the destruction of in conveniently knowing or
over communicative persons had been really devised and carried out by
the jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely
when here collected the general nature of the altercations between that
gentleman and mr sikes which seemed to bear reference to some
foregone conspiracy of the kinda she glanced timidly up and met the
jews searching look he felt that his paleface and trembling limbs
were neither unnoticed no run relished by that wary old gentleman

the jew smiling hideously patted oliver on the head and said that
if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they
would be very good friends yet then taking his hat and covering
himself with an old patched great coa the went out and locked the
room door behind him

and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many
subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and
left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts which
never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must
long ago have formed of him were sad indeed

after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the room door unlocked
and he was at liberty to wander about the house

it was a very dirty place the rooms upstairs had great high wooden
chimney pieces and large doors with panelled walls and cornices to the
ceiling which although they were black with neglect and dust were
ornamented in various ways from all of these tokens oliver concluded
that along time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to
better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome dismal and
dreary as it looked now

spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings
and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would
scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes with
these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living
thing and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from
room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the
street door to be as near living people a she could and would remain
there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys
returned

in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed the bars
which held them were screwed tight into the wood the only light which
was admitted stealing its way through round holes at the top which
made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows there
was a back garret window with rusty bars outside which had no shutter
and out of this oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours
together but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and
crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gable ends
sometimes indeed a grizzly head might be seen peering over the
parapet wall of a distant house but it was quickly withdrawn again
and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed
with the rain and smoke of years it was as much a she could do to make
out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any
attempt to be seen or heard which he had as much chance of being as
if he had lived inside the ball of st pauls cathedral

one afternoon the dodger and masterbates being engaged out that
evening the first named young gentleman took it into his head to
evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person to do him
justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him and with
this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in
his toilet straightway

oliver was but too glad to make himself useful too happy to have some
faces however bad to lookup on too desirous to conciliate those
about him when he could honestly do so to throw any objection in the
way of this proposal so heat once expressed his readiness and
kneeling on the floor while the dodgers at upon the table so that he
could take his foot in his lap she applied himself to a process which
mr dawkins designated as japan ning his trotter cases the phrase
rendered into plain english signifie th cleaning his boots

whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
animal maybe supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy
attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and
having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of
having taken them of for the prospective misery of putting the mon to
disturb his reflections or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco
that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer
that mollified his thoughts he was evidently tincture d for then once
with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature
he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief
space and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sign said
half in abstraction and half to masterbates

what a pity it is he isnt apr ig

ah said master charles bates he dont know whats good for him

the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe as did charley bates
they both smoked for some seconds in silence

i suppose you dont even know what apr i gis said the dodger
mournfully

i think i know that replied oliver looking up its a the you re
one are you not inquired oliver checking himself

i am replied the dodge rid scorn to be anything else mr
dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment
and looked at masterbates as if to denote that he would feel obliged
by his saying anything to the contrary

i am repeated the dodgers os charley sos fagin sos sikes
sos nancy sos bet so we all are down to the dog and hes the
downie stone of the lot

and the least given top eaching added charley bates

he wouldnt so much as barkin a witness box for fear of committing
himself no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without
witt les for a fortnight said the dodger

not abit of it observed charley

he sarum dog don the look fierce at any strange cove that laughs
or sings when he sin company pursued the dodger won the growl at
all when he hears a fiddle playing and don the hate other dogs as
a int of his breed ohno

he san out and out christian said charley

this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it
was an appropriate remark in another sense if masterbates had only
known it for there area good many ladies and gentlemen claiming to
be out and out christians between whom and mr sikes dog there
exist strong and singular points of resemblance

well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they
had strayed with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced
all his proceedings this hasnt go anything to do with young green
here

no more it has said charley why dont you put yourself under
fagin oliver

and make your for tun out of hand added the dodger with a grin

and so be able to retire on your property and do the genteel as i
mean to in the very next leap year but four that ever comes and the
forty second tuesday in trinity week said charley bates

i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly i wish they would let me
go ii would rather go

and fagin would rather not rejoined charley

oliver knew this too well but thinking it might be dangerous to
express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his
boot cleaning

go exclaimed the dodger why where s your spirit dont you take
any pride out of yourself would you go and be dependent on your
friends

oh blow that said masterbates drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard
thats too mean that is

i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust

you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile
and let them be punished for what you did

that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out
of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work
together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our
lucky that was the move wasnt it charley

masterbates nodded assent and would have spoken but there collection
of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was
inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and
down into his throat and broughton a fit of coughing and stamping
about five minutes long

look here said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and
halfpence here sa jolly life whats the odds where it comes from
here catch hold theres plenty more where they were took from you
wont wont you oh you precious flat

its naughty a int it oliver inquired charley bates hell come
to be sc ragged won the

i dont know what that means replied oliver

something in this way old feller said charly a she said it master
bates caught up an end of his neckerchief and holding it erect in the
air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious sound
through his teeth thereby indicating by a lively pan to mimic
representation that sc ragging and hanging were one and the same thing

thats what it means said charley look how he stares jack

in ever did see such prime company as that ere boy hell be the death
of me i know he will master charley bates having laughed heartily
again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes

youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with
much satisfaction when oliver had polished them fagin will make
something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that
turned out unprofitable you d better begin at once for youll come to
the trade long before you think of it and you re only losing time
oliver

masterbates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his
own which being exhausted he and his friend mr dawkins launched
into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the
life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the
best thing he could do would be to secure fagin s favour without more
delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it

and always put this in your pipe no lly said the dodger as the jew
was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogel sand
tickers

whats the good of talking in that way interposed masterbate she
dont know what you mean

if you dont take pocket handke chers and watches said the dodger
reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some
other cove will so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse
and youll be all the worse too and nobody half aha porth the
better except the chap swot gets them and youve just as good a right
to them as they have

to be sure to be sure said the jew who had entered unseen by
oliver it all lies in a nutshell my dear in a nutshell take the
dodgers word for it hahaha he understands the catechism of his
trade

the oldman rubbed his hands gleefully together a she corroborated the
dodgers reasoning in these terms and chuckled with delight a this
pupils proficiency

the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had
returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver
had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom
chit ling and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
gallant ries with the lady now made his appearance

mr chit ling was older in years than the dodger having perhaps
numbered eighteen winters but there was a degree of deference in his
deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that
he felt himself conscious of as light inferiority in point of genius
and professional a quirements he had small twinkling eyes and a
pockmarked face wore a fur capa dark corduroy jacket greasy
fust ian trousers and an apron his wardrobe was in truth rather out
of repair but he excused himself to the company by stating that his
time was only out an hour before and that in consequence of having
worn the regimentals for six week spas the had not be enable to bestow
any attention on his private clothes mr chit ling added with strong
marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder
was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there
was no remedy against the county the same remark he considered to
apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair which he held to be
decidedly unlawful mr chit ling wound up his observations by stating
that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty two moral long
hardworking days and that he wished he might be busted if he war nt
as dry as a lime basket

where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver inquired the
jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the
table

ii dont know sir replied oliver

whos that inquired tom chit ling casting a contemptuous look at
oliver

a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew

he sin luck then said the youngman with a meaning look at fagin
nevermind where i came from young un youll find your way there
soon enough ill beta crown

at this sally the boys laughed after some more jokes on the same
subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin and withdrew

after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew
their chairs towards the fire and the jew telling oliver to come and
sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to
interest his hearers these were the great advantages of the trade
the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the
liberality of the jew himself at length these subjects displayed signs
of being thoroughly exhausted and mr chit ling did the same for the
house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two miss betsy
accordingly withdrew and left the party to their repose

from this day oliver was seldom left alone but was placed in almost
constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with
the jew everyday whether for their own improvement or oliver smr
fagin best knew at other times the oldman would tell them stories of
robberies he had committed in his younger days mixed up with so much
that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing
heartily and showing that he was amused inspite of all his better
feelings

in short the wily old jew had the boy in hist oils having prepared
his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the
companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place he was
now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would
blacken it and change its hue forever




chapter xix
in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on


it was a chill damp windy night when the jew buttoning his
greatcoat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up
over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face
emerged from his den he paused on the step as the door was locked and
chained behind him and having listened while the boys made all secure
and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down
the street as quickly a she could

the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of
whitechapel the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the
street and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck
off in the direction of the spitalfields

the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hungover the
streets the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and
clammy to the touch it seemed just the night when it be fitted such a
being as the jew to be abroad a she glided stealthily along creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous oldman
seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and
darkness through which he moved crawling forth by night in search of
some rich offal for a meal

he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he
reached bethnal green then turning suddenly off to the left he soon
became involved in amaze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
that close and densely populated quarter

the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be
at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the
intricacies of the way he hurried through several alleys and streets
and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the
farther end at the door of a house in this street he knocked having
exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened i the walked
upstairs

a dog growled a she touched the handle of a room door andamans
voice demanded who was there

only me bill only me my dear said the jew looking in

bring in your body then said sikes lie down you stupid brute
dont you know the devil when hes got a greatcoat on

apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr fagin souter
garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a
chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen wagging his
tail a she went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his
nature to be

well said sikes

well my dear replied the jew ah nancy

the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
imply a doubt of its reception for mr fagin and his young friend had
not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver all doubts upon
the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys
behaviour she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair and
bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it for it was a cold
night and no mistake

it is cold nancy dear said the je was he warmed his skinny hands
over the fire it seems to go right through one added the oldman
touching his side

it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said
mr sikes give him something to drink nancy burn my body make
haste its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old car case
shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave

nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were
many which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were
filled with several kinds of liquids sikes pouring out a glass of
brandy bade the jew drink it off

quite enough quite thank ye bill replied the jew putting down the
glass after just setting his lips to it

what you re afraid of our getting the better of you are you
inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew ugh

with a hoarse grunt of contempt mr sikes seized the glass and threw
the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony
to filling it again for himself which he did at once

the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second
glass ful not in curiousity for he had seen it often before but in a
restless and suspicious manner habitual to him it was a meanly
furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to
induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man and
with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a life preserver that
hungover the chimney piece

there said sikes smacking his lips now im ready

for business inquired the jew

for business replied sikes so say what youve got to say

about the crib at chertsey bill said the jew drawing his chair
forward and speaking in a very low voice

yes wot about it inquired sikes

ah you know what i mean my dear said the jew he knows what i
mean nancy don the

no he dont sneered mr sikes or he wont and thats the same
thing speakout and call things by their right names dont sit
there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you
war nt the very first that thought about the robbery wot dye mean

hush bill hush said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop
this burst of indignation somebody will hear us my dear somebody
will hear us

let em hear said sikes i dont care but as mr sikes did
care on reflection he dropped his voice a she said the words and
grew calmer

there there said the jew coaxing ly it was only my caution
nothing more now my dear about that crib at chertsey when is it to
be done bill eh when is it to be done such plate my dear such
plate said the jew rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in
a rapture of anticipation

not at all replied sikes coldly

not to be done at all echoed the jew leaning back in his chair

no not at all rejoined sikes atleast it cant be a put up job
as we expected

then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale
with anger dont tell me

but i will tell you retorted sikes who are you thats not to be
told i tell you that to by crack it has been hanging about the place for
a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants inline

do you mean to tell me bill said the jew softening as the other
grew heated that neither of the t women in the house can be got
over

yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes the old lady has had
em these twenty years and if you were to give em five hundred pound
they wouldnt be in it

but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the
women cant be got over

not abit of it replied sikes

not by flash to by crack it said the jew incredulously think what
women are bill

no not even by flash to by crack it replied sikes he says he sworn
sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes been
loitering down there and its all of no use

he should have tried must a chios and a pair of military trousers my
dear said the jew

so he did rejoined sikes and they warn to fno more use than the
other plant

the jew looked blank at this information after ruminating for some
minutes with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his head and said
with a deep sigh that if flash to by crack it reported a right he feared
the game was up

and yet said the oldman dropping his hands on his knees its a
sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon
it

so it is said mr sikes worse luck

along silence ensued during which the jew was plunged in deep
thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy
perfectly demoniacal sikes eyed him furtively from time to time
nancy apparently fearful of irritating the house breakers at with her
eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed

fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed
is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the
outside

yes said the je was suddenly rousing himself

is it a bargain inquired sikes

yes my dear yes rejoined the jew his eyes glistening and every
muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had
awakened

then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain
let it come off as soon as you like to by and me were over the
garden wall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and
shutters the cribs barred up at night like a jail but theres one
part we can crack safe and softly

which is that bill asked the jew eagerly

why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn

yes said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost
starting out of it

umph cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her
head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews
face nevermind which part it is you cant do it without me i know
but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you

as you like my dear as you like replied the jew is there no help
wanted but yours and to by s

none said sikes cept a centre bit and a boy the first weve both
got the second you must find us

a boy exclaimed the jew oh then its a panel eh

nevermind w otitis replied sikes i want a boy and hemus nt be
a big unlord said mr sikes reflectively if id only got that
youngboy of ned the chim bley sweeper she kept him small on purpose
and let him out by the job but the father gets lagged and then the
juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from a trade
where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and in time
makes a prentice of him and so they go on said mr sikes his wrath
rising with there collection of his wrongs so they go on and if
they d got money enough which its a providence they havent we
shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year or
two

no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering
during this speech and had only caught the last sentence bill

what now inquired sikes

the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the
fire and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave
the room sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought
the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting
miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer

you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining
her seat very composedly

i tell you i do replied sikes

nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin i know what hes
going to say bill he need nt mind me

the jew still hesitated sikes looked from one to the other in some
surprise

why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin he asked at length
youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it she
a in tone to blab are you nancy

i should think not replied the young lady drawing her chair up to
the table and putting her elbows upon it

no no my dear i know you re not said the jew but and again
the oldman paused

but wot inquired sikes

i didnt know whether she might ntp raps be out of sorts you know
my dear as she was the other night replied the jew

at this confession miss nancy burst into aloud laugh and swallowing
a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst
into sundry exclamations of keep the game a going never say die
and the like these seemed to have the effect of reassuring both
gentlemen for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and
resumed his seat as did mr sikes likewise

now fagin said nancy with a laugh tell bill at once about
oliver

ha your ea clever one my dear the sharpest girl i ever saw said
the jew patting her on the neck it was about oliveri was going to
speak sure enough hahaha

what about him demanded sikes

hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper
laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully

he exclaimed sikes

have him bill said nancy i would if i was in your place he
may nt be so much up as any of the others but thats not what you
want if hes only to open a door for you depend upon i the sa safe
one bill

i know he is rejoined fagin hes been in good training these last
few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread besides the
others are all too big

well he is just the size i want said mr sikes ruminating

and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew
he cant help himself that is if you frighten him enough

frighten him echoed sikes itll be no sham frightening mind you
if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the work in
for a penny in for a pound you wont see him alive again fagin
think of that before you send him mark my words said the robber
po is in ga crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead

ive thought of it all said the jew with energy ive ive had my
eye upon him my dears closeclose once let him feel that he is one
of us once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief and
he sours ours for his life oho it couldnt have come about better
the oldman crossed his arms upon his breast and drawing his head and
shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy

ours said sikes yours you mean

perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle mine if
you like bill

and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot
makes you take so much pains about one chalk faced kid when you know
there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden everynight as you
might pick and choose from

because they re of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some
confusion not worth the taking their looks convict em when they get
into trouble and ilo seem all with this boy properly managed my
dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them besides said
the jew recovering his self possession he has us now if he could
only give us leg bail again and he must be in the same boat with us
nevermind how he came there its quite enough for my power over him
that he was in a robbery that salli want now how much better this
is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way which
would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides

when is it to be done asked nancy stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of mr sikes expressive of the disgust with
which he received fagin s affectation of humanity

ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done bill

i planned with to by the night arter tomorrow rejoined sikes in a
surly voice if hehee rd nothing from me to the contr airy

good said the jew theres no moon

no rejoined sikes

its all arranged about bringing off the swag is it asked the jew

sikes nodded

and about

oh a hits all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him never
mind particulars you d better bring the boy here tomorrow night i
shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak then you hold your
tongue and keep the melting pot ready and thats all youll have to
do

after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was
decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the
night had set in and bring oliver away with her fagin craftily
observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would
be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in
his behalf than anybody else it was also solemnly arranged that poor
oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be
unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr william sikes
and further that the said sikes should deal with him a she thought
fit and should not beheld responsible by the jew for any mischance or
evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to
render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by
mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and
corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash
to by crack it

these preliminaries adjusted mr sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner
yelling for that the same time most unmusical snatches of song
mingled with wild execration sat length in a fit of professional
enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools
which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of
explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it
contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he
fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell

goodnight nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before

goodnight

their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly there was no
flinching about the girls he was as true and earnest in the matter as
to by crack it himself could be

the jew again bade her goodnight and bestowing a sly kick upon the
prostrate form of mr sikes while her back was turned groped
downstairs

always the way muttered the jew to himself a she turned homeward
the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call
up some long forgotten feeling and the best of them is that it never
last shah a the man against the child for a bag of gold

beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections mr fagin wended
his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode where the dodger
was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return

is oliver abedi want to speak to him was his first remark as they
descended the stairs

hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door here he is

the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor so pale
with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he
looked like death not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in
the guise it wears when life has just departed when a young and gentle
spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the
world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed

not now said the jew turning softly away tomorrow tomorrow




chapter xx
where in oliver is delivered over to mr william sikes


when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find
that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at
his bedside and that his old shoes had been removed at first he was
pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of
his release but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting
down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in at one and
manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the
residence of bill sikes that night

to to stop there sir asked oliver anxiously

no no my dear not to stop there replied the jew we shouldnt
like to lose you dont be afraid oliver you shall comeback to us
again hahaha we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear
ohno no

the oldman who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread
looked round a she bantered oliver thus and chuckled as if to show
that he knew he would still be very glad to getaway if he could

i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know
what you re going to bills for eh my dear

oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been
reading his thoughts but boldly said yes he did want to know

why do you think inquired fagin parrying the question

indeed i dont know sir replied oliver

bah said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from
a close perusal of the boys face wait till bill tells you then

the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although oliver felt
very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
fagin s looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries
just then he had no other opportunity for the jew remained very surly
and silent till night when he prepared to goabroad

you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table and
here sa book for you to read till they come to fetch you
goodnight

goodnight replied oliver softly

the jew walked to the door looking over his shoulder at the boy a she
went suddenly stopping he called him by his name

oliver looked up the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to
light i the did so and a she placed the candlestick upon the table
saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and
contracted brows from the dark end of the room

take heed oliver take heed said the oldman shaking his right
hand before him in a warning manner hesa rough man and thinks
nothing of blood when his own is up whatever falls out say nothing
and do what he bids you mind placing a strong emphasis on the last
word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a
ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room

oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the oldman disappeared and
pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard the
more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to
divine its real purpose and meaning

he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes
which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin
and after meditating for along time concluded that he had been
selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the house breaker
until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged he
was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where
he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely he remained
lost in thought for some minutes and then with a heavy sigh snuffed
the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him
began to read

he turned over the leaves carelessly at first but lighting on a
passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the
volume it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals
and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use here he read of
dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold of secret murders that
had been committed by the lonely wayside of bodies hidden from the eye
of man in deep pits and wells which would not keep them down deep as
they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so
maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had
confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony
here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night
had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad thoughts
to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs
quail to think of the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid
that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore and the words upon
them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow
murmurs by the spirits of the dead

in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him
then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such
deeds and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved
for crimes so fearful and appalling by degrees he grew more calm
and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from
his present dangers and that if any aid were to be raised up for a
poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it
might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in
the midst of wickedness and guilt

he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in
his hands when a rustling noise aroused him

whats that he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure
standing by the door whos there

me only me replied a tremulous voice

oliver raised the candle above his head and looked towards the door
it was nancy

put down the light said the girl turning away her head it hurts
my eyes

oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill
the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him and
wrung her hands but made no reply

god forgive me she cried after a while in ever thought of this

has anything happened asked oliver can i help you i will if i
can i will indeed

she rocked herself to and fro caught her throat and uttering a
gurgling sound gasped for breath

nancy cried oliver what is it

the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground
and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her and shivered
with cold

oliver stirred the fire drawing her chair close to it she sat there
for a little time without speaking but at length she raised her head
and looked round

i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to
busy herself in arranging her dress its this damp dirty room i
thin known olly dear are you ready

am i to go with you asked oliver

yes i have come from bill replied the girl you are to go with
me

what for asked oliver recoiling

what for echoed the girl raising here yes and averting them again
the moment they encountered the boys face oh for no harm

i dont believe it said oliver who had watched her closely

have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh for no
good then

oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better
feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion
for his helpless state but then the thought darted across his mind
that it was barely eleven oclock and that many people were still in
the streets of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his
tale as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward and said
somewhat hastily that he was ready

neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his
companion she eyed him narrowly while he spoke and cast upon him a
look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what
had been passing in his thoughts

hush said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as
she looked cautiously round you cant help yourself i have tried
hard for you but all to no purpose you are hedged round and round if
ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time

struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with
great surprise she seemed to speak the truth her countenance was
white and agitated and she trembled with very earnestness

i have saved you from being ill used once and i will again and i do
now continued the girl aloud for those who would have fetched you
if i had not would have been far more rough than me i have promised
for your being quiet and silent if you are not you will only do harm
to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death see here i have borne
all this for you already as true as god sees me show it

she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and arms and
continued with great rapidity

remember this and dont let me suffer more for you just no wifi
could help you i would but i have not the power they dont mean to
harm you whatever they make you do is no fault of your shush every
word from you is a blow for me give me your hand make haste your
hand

she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and
blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs the door was
opened quickly by someone shrouded in the darkness and was as
quickly closed when they had passed out a hackney cabriolet was in
waiting with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing
oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close
the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed
without the delay of an instant

the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued top our into
his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted all was
so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he
was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the house to
which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening

for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty
street and a cry for help hung upon his lips but the girls voice was
in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her that
he had not the heart to utter it while he hesitated the opportunity
was gone he was already in the house and the door was shut

this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time
bill

hallo replied sikes appearing at the head of the stairs with a
candle oh thats the timeofday come on

this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty
welcome from a person of mr sikes temperament nancy appearing much
gratified thereby saluted him cordially

bullseye s gone home with tom observed sikes a she lighted them
up hed have been in the way

thats right rejoined nancy

so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room
closing the door a she spoke

yes here he is replied nancy

did he come quiet inquired sikes

like alambre joined nancy

im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver for the
sake of his young car case as would other ways have suffered for it
come here young un and let me read you alec tur which is as well
got over at once

thus addressing his new pupil mr sikes pulled off olivers cap and
threw it into a corner and then taking him by the shoulders at
himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him

now first do you know wot this is inquired sikes taking up a
pocket pistol which lay on the table

oliver replied in the affirmative

well then look here continued sikes this is powder that eres
a bullet and this is a littlebit of a old hat for w add in

oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to
and mr sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and
deliberation

now its loaded said mr sikes when he had finished

yes i see it is sir replied oliver

well said the robber grasping olivers wrist and putting the
barrel so close to his temple that they touched at which moment the
boy could notre press a start if you speak a word when you re out
o doors with me except when is peak to you that loading will be in
your head without notice so if you do makeup your mind to speak
without leave say your prayers first

having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase
its effect mr sikes continued

as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very
par tickler arter you if you was disposed of so i need nt take this
devil and all of trouble to explain matters to you if it war nt for
your own good dye hear me

the short and the long of what you mean said nancy speaking very
emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to be speak his
serious attention to her words is that if you re crossed by him in
this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales
afterwards by shooting him through the head and will take your chance
of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way
of business every month of your life

that sit observed mr sikes approvingly women can always put
things in fewest words except when its blowing up and then they
lengthens it out and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have
some supper and get a snooze before starting

in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth
disappearing for a few minutes she presently returned with a pot of
porter and a dish of sheepshead s which gave occasion to several
pleasant witticisms on the part of mr sikes founded upon the singular
coincidence of jem mies being a can name common to them and also to
an ingenious implement much used in his profession indeed the worthy
gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on
active service was in great spirits and good humour in proof where of
it maybe here remarked that he humourous lyd rank all the beer at a
draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than
fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal

supper being ended it maybe easily conceived that oliver had no great
appetite for it mr sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits
and water and threw himself on the bed ordering nancy with many
imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely oliver
stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on
a mattress upon the floor and the girl mending the fires at before
it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time

for along time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy
might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the
girls at brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to
trim the light weary with watching and anxiety heat length fell
asleep

when he awoke the table was covered with tea things and sikes was
thrusting various articles into the pockets of his greatcoat which
hungover the back of a chair nancy was busily engaged in preparing
breakfast it was not yet daylight for the candle was still burning
and it was quite dark outside a sharp rain too was beating against
the windowpanes and the sky looked black and cloudy

now then growled sikes as oliver started up half past five look
sharp or youll get no breakfast for its late as it is

oliver was not long in making his toilet having taken some breakfast
he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite
ready

nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie
round his throat sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his
shoulders thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely
pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same
pistol in aside pocket of his greatcoat clasped it firmly in his
and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away

oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope
of meeting a look from the girl but she had resumed herold seat in
front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it




chapter xxi
the expedition


it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street blowing and
raining hard and the clouds looking dull and stormy the night had
been very wet large pools of water had collected in the road and the
kennels were overflowing there was a faint glimmering of the coming
day in the sky but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the
scene the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street
lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the
wet housetops and dreary streets there appeared to be nobody
stirring in that quarter of the town the windows of the houses were
all closely shut and the streets through which they passed were
noiseless and empty

by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had
fairly begun to break many of the lamps were already extinguished a
few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london now and
then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by the driver
bestowing a she passed an ad monitory lash upon the heavy waggoner
who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his
arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time the
public houses with gas lights burning inside were already open by
degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people
were met with then came straggling groups of labourers going to their
work then men and women with fish baskets on their heads
donkey carts laden with vegetables chaise carts filled with livestock
or whole carcasses of meat milk women with pails an unbroken
concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern
suburbs of the town as they approached the city the noise and traffic
gradually increased when they threaded the streets between shoreditch
and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle it was
as light as it was likely to be till night came on again and the busy
morning of half the london population had begun

turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square
mr sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican thence into
long lane and so into smithfield from which latter place arose a
tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement

it was market morning the ground was covered nearly ankle deep with
filth and mire a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking
bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest
upon the chimney tops hung heavily above all the pens in the centre
of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into
the vacant space were filled with sheep tied up to posts by the
gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep
countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and
vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass the
whistling of drovers the barking dogs the bellowing and plunging of
the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs
the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides
the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every
public house the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and
yelling the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every
corner of the market and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty
figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the
throng rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite
confounded the senses

mr sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the
thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the
numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy he nodded
twice or thrice to a passing friend and resisting as many
invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they
were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane
into holborn

now young unsaid sikes looking up at the clock of st andrews
church hard upon seven you must step outcome dont lag behind
already lazy legs

mr sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk a this little companions
wrist oliver quickening hi space into a kind of trot between a fast
walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the house breaker as
well a she could

they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park
corner and were on their way to kensington when sikes relaxed his
pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind
came up seeing hounslow written on i the asked the driver with as
much civility a she could assume if he would give them a lift as far
as isleworth

jump up said the man is that your boy

yes hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting
his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was

your father walks rather too quick for you don the my man
inquired the driver seeing that oliver was out of breath

not abit of it replied sikes interposing hes used to i there
take hold of my hand ned in with you

thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart and the driver
pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest
himself

as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and
more where his companion meant to take him kensington hammersmith
chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed and yet they went on
as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey at length
they came to a public house called the coach and horses a little way
beyond which another road appeared to runoff and here the cart
stopped

sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand
all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look
upon him and rapped the side pocket with his fistin a significant
manner

goodbye boy said the man

hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake hes sulky a young
dog dont mind him

not i rejoined the other getting into his cart its a fine day
after all and he drove away

sikes waited until he had fairly gone and then telling oliver he
might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his
journey

they turned round to the left a short way past the public house and
then taking a righthand road walked on for along time passing many
large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and
stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town here
against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large
letters hampton they lingered about in the fields for some hours
at length they came back into the town and turning into an old
public house with a defaced sign board ordered some dinner by the
kitchen fire

the kitchen was an old low roofed room with a great beam across the
middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the
fire on which were seated several rough men in smock frocks drinking
and smoking they took no notice of oliver and very little of sikes
and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade
satin a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their
company

they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while mr
sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to
feel quite certain they were not going any further being much tired
with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first
then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell
asleep

it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes rousing
himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy
in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint
of ale

so you re going on to lower hall i ford are you inquired sikes

yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worse or better
as the case might be for drinking and not slow about it neither my
horse hasnt got a load behind him going back a she had coming up in
the mornin and he wont belong a doing of i theres luck to him
e cod hesa good un

could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there demanded sikes
pushing the ale towards his new friend

if you re going directly i can replied the man looking out of the
pot are you going to hall i ford

going on to shepperton replied sikes

im your man as far as i go replied the other is all paid
becky

yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl

i say said the man with tipsy gravity that wont do you know

why not rejoined sikes your ea going to accommodate us and wots
to prevent my standing treat for a pin torso in return

the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face
having done so he seized sikes by the hand and declared he was a real
goodfellow to which mr sikes replied he was joking as if he had
been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was

after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company
goodnight and went out the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see
the party start

the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing
outside ready harnessed to the cart oliver and sikes got in without
any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered
for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the
world to produce his equal mounted also then the hostler was told to
give the horse his head and his head being given him he made a very
unpleasant use of it tossing it into the air with great disdain and
running into the parlour windows over the way after performing those
feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs he
started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right
gallantly

the night was very dark adam pm ist rose from the river and the
marshy ground about and spread itself over the dreary fields it was
piercing cold too all was gloomy and black not a word was spoken
for the driver had grown sleepy and sikes was in no mood to lead him
into conversation oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the
cart bewildered with alarm and apprehension and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as
if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene

as they passed sunbury church the clocks trucks even there was a
light in the ferry house window opposite which streamed across the
road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves
beneath it there was a dull sound of fallingwater not far off and
the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the nightwind it seemed
like quiet music for the repose of the dead

sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road
two or three miles more and the cart stopped sikes alighted took
oliver by the hand and they once again walked on

they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected
but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes
and over cold open wastes until they came with insight of the lights
of a town at no great distance on looking intently forward oliver saw
that the water was just below them and that they were coming to the
foot of a bridge

sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge then
turned suddenly down a bank upon the left

the water thought oliver turning sick with fear he has brought me
to this lonely place to murder me

he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for
his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house
all ruinous and decayed there was a window on each side of the
dilapidated entrance and one story above but no light was visible
the house was dark dismantled and the all appearance uninhabited

sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low
porch and raised the latch the door yielded to the pressure and they
passed in together




chapter xxii
the burglary


hallo cried aloud hoarse voice as soon as they set foot in the
passage

dont make such a row said sikes bolting the door show a glim
to by

aha mypal cried the same voice a glim barney a glim show the
gentleman in barney wakeup first if convenient

the speaker appeared to throw a boot jack or some such article at the
person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers for the noise of a
wooden body falling violently was heard and then an indistinct
muttering as of a man between sleep and awake

do you hear cried the same voice theres bill sikes in the passage
with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you
took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger are you any
fresher now or do you want their on candlestick to wake you
thoroughly

a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the
room as this interrogatory was put and there issued from a door on
the righthand first a feeble candle and next the form of the same
individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at
the public house on saffron hill

b ister sikes exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy cub
ids irc ubid

here you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him
quicker or i shall tread upon your heels

muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him
and they entered a low darkroom with a smoky fire two or three broken
chairs a table and a very old couch on which with his legs much
higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking along
clay pipe he was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat with
large brass buttons an orange neckerchief a coarse staring
shawl pattern waistcoat and drab breeches mr crack it for he it was
had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face but
what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew
curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers
ornamented with large common rings he was at rifle above the middle
size and apparently rather weak in the legs but this circumstance by
no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots which he
contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction

bill my boy said this figure turning his head towards the door
im glad to see you i was almost afraid you d given it up in which
case i should have made a personal went ur hallo

uttering this exclamation in at one of great surprise as his eyes
rested on oliver mr to by crack it brought himself into a sitting
posture and demanded who that was

the boy only the boy replied sikes drawing a chair towards the
fire

wud of b ister fag i dsl ads exclaimed barney with a grin

fagin seh exclaimed to by looking at oliver wotan in wal able boy
that ll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels his mug is a
fort into him

there theres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently and
stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his
ear at which mr crack it laughed immensely and honoured oliver with a
long stare of astonishment

now said sikes a she resumed his seat if youll give us something
to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in us or
in meat all events sitdown by the fire younker and rest yourself
for youll have to go out with us again tonight though not very far
off

oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder and drawing as tool
to the fires at with his aching head upon his hands scare cely knowing
where he was or what was passing around him

here said to by as the young jew placed some fragments of food and
a bottle upon the table success to the crack he rose to honour the
toast and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner advanced
to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank of fits contents
mr sikes did the same

a drain for the boy said to by half filling a wineglass down with
it innocence

indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face
indeed i

down with it echoed to by do you think i dont know whats good for
you tell him to drink it bill

he had better said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket burn my
body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers drink
it you per we rse imp drink it

frightened by the menacing gestures of the t women oliver hastily
swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a
violent fit of coughing which delighted to by crack it and barney and
even drew a smile from the surly mr sikes

this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat
nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the
t women laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap oliver retained
his stool by the fire barney wrapped in a blanket stretched himself
on the floor close outside the fender

they slept or appeared to sleep for sometime nobody stirring but
barney who rose once or twice to throw coalson the fire oliver fell
into a heavy doze imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes
or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing someone or other
of the scenes of the past day when he was roused by to by crack it
jumping up and declaring it was half past one

in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively
engaged in busy preparation sikes and his companion enveloped their
necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their great coats
barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he
hastily crammed into the pockets

barkers for me barney said to by crack it

here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols you
loaded them yourself

all right replied to by stowing them away the persuaders

ive got em replied sikes

crape keys centre bits darkies nothing forgotten inquired to by
fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat

all right rejoined his companion bring them bits of timber
barney thats the timeofday

with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who
having delivered another to to by busied himself in fastening on
oliver scape

now then said sikes holding out his hand

oliver who was completely st up ified by the unwonted exercise and the
air and the drink which had been forced upon him put his hand
mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose

take his other hand to by said sikes lookout barney

the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet
the two robbers issued forthwith oliver between them barney having
made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again

it was now intensely dark the fog was much heavier than it had been in
the early part of the night and the atmosphere was so damp that
although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes
after leaving the house had become stiff with the half frozen moisture
that was floating about they crossed the bridge and kept on towards
the lights which he had seen before they were at no great distance
off and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey

slap through the town whispered sikes there ll be nobody in the
way tonight to see us

to by acquiesced and they hurried through the mainstreet of the little
town which at that late hour was wholly deserted a dim light shone at
intervals from some bedroom window and the hoarse barking of dogs
occasionally broke the silence of the night but there was nobody
abroad they had cleared the town as the church bell struck two

quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the lefthand after
walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house
surrounded by a wall to the top of which to by crack it scarcely
pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling

the boy next said to by hoist him up ill catch hold of him

before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the
arms and in three or four second she and to by we relying on the grass
on the other side sikes followed directly and they stole cautiously
towards the house

and now for the first time oliver wellnigh mad with grief and
terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the
objects of the expedition he clasped his hands together and
involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror a mist came
before his eyes the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face his limbs
failed him and he sank upon his knees

get up murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol
from his pocket get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass

oh for gods sake let me go cried oliver let me runaway and die
in the fields i will never come near london never never oh pray
have mercy on me and do not make me steal for the love of all the
bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me

the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had
cocked the pistol when to by striking it from his grasp placed his
hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house

hush cried the man it wont answer here say another word and
ill do your business myself with a crack on the head that makes no
noise and is quite ascertain and more genteel here bill wrench
the shutter open hes game enough no will engage ive seen older
hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold
night

sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagin s head for sending
oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little
noise after some delay and some assistance from to by the shutter to
which he had referred swung open on its hinges

it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the
ground at the back of the house which belonged to a scullery or
small brewing place at the end of the passage the aperture was so
small that the inmates had probably not thought it worthwhile to
defend it more securely but it was large enough to admit a boy of
olivers size nevertheless a very brief exercise of mr sikes art
sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice and it soon stood
wide open also

now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern
from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face ima
going to put you through there take this light go softly up the steps
straight afore you and along the little hall to the street door
unfasten it and let us in

theresa bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed
to by stand upon one of the hall chairs there are three there bill
with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork one m which is the
old ladys arms

keep quiet cant you replied sikes with a threatening look the
room door is open is it

wide replied to by after peeping into satisfy himself the game of
that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog
whos got abedin here may walkup and down the passage when he feels
wakeful haha barney ticed him away to nights one at

although mr crack it spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed
without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get
to work to by complied by first producing his lantern and placing it
on the ground then by planting himself firmly with his head against
the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to
make a step of his back this was no sooner done than sikes mounting
upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first
and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the
floor inside

take this lantern said sikes looking into the room you see the
stairs afore you

oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes sikes pointing to the
street door with the pistol barrel briefly advised him to take notice
that he was within shot all the way and that if he faltered he would
fall dead that instant

its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper directly
i leave go of you do your work hark

whats that whispered the other man

they listened intently

nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver now

in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly
resolved that whether he died in the attempt or no the would make one
effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family filled
with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily

comeback suddenly cried sikes aloud back back

scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and
by aloud cry which followed it oliver le this lantern fall and knew
not whether to advance or fly

the cry was repeated a light appeared a vision of two terrified
half dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes a
flash aloud noise a smoke a crash somewhere but where he knew
not and he staggered back

sikes had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him
by the collar before the smoke had cleared away he fired his own
pistol after the men who were already retreating and dragged the boy
up

clasp your arm tighter said sikes a she drew him through the
window give me a shawl here theyve hit him quick how the boy
bleeds

then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of
firearms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried
over uneven ground at a rapid pace and then the noises grew confused
in the distance and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart
and he saw or heard no more




chapter xxiii
which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between mr
bumble and a lady and shows that even a beadle maybe susceptible on
some points


the night was bitter cold the snow lay on the ground frozen into a
hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into by ways
and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad which
as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it
savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies
scattered it in air bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night for
the well housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god
they were at home and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him
down and die many hunger worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may
can hardly open them in a more bitter world

such was the aspect of out of doors affairs when mrs corney the
matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already
introduced as the birthplace of oliver twists at herself down before a
cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree
of complacency at a small roundtable on which stood at ray of
corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most
grateful meal that matrons enjoy in fact mrs corney was about to
solace herself with a cup of tea as she glanced from the table to the
fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a
small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently
increased so much so indeed that mrs corney smiled

well said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking
reflectively at the fire im sure we have all on usa great deal to
be grateful for a great deal if we did but know it ah

mrs corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental
blindness of those paupers who did not know it and thrusting a silver
spoon private property into the in most recesses of a two ounce tin
tea caddy proceeded to make the tea

how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds the
black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while mrs
corney was moralising and the water slightly scalded mrs corney s
hand

dr at the pot said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on
the hob a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups what
use is it of to anybody except said mrs corney pausing except
to a poor desolate creature like meoh dear

with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more
resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate the small
teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad recollections
of mr corney who had not been dead more than five and twenty years
and she was overpowered

i shall never get another said mrs corney pettis hly i shall
never get another like him

whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is
uncertain it might have been the latter for mrs corney looked at it
as she spoke and took it up afterwards she had just tasted her first
cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door

oh come in with you said mrs corney sharply some of the old
women dying i suppose they always die when im at meals dont stand
there letting the cold air in dont what sam is snow eh

nothing ma am nothing replied a mans voice

dear me exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that mr
bumble

at your service ma am said mr bumble who had been stopping
outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat and
who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
bundle in the other shall i shut the door ma am

the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any
impropriety in holding an interview with mr bumble with closed doors
mr bumble taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold
himself shut it without permission

hard weather mr bumble said the matron

hard indeed ma am replied the beadle an tip orochi al weather
this ma am we have given away mrs corney we have given away a
matter of twenty quarter n loaves and a cheese and a half this very
blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented

of course not when would they be mr bumble said the matron
sipping her tea

when indeed ma am rejoined mr bumble why heres one man that
in consideration of his wife and large family has a quarter n loaf and
a good pound of cheese full weight is he grateful ma am is he
grateful not a copper farthings worth of it what does he doma am
but ask for a few coals if its only a pocket handkerchief full he
says coals what would he do with coals to as this cheese with em and
then comeback for more thats the way with these people ma am give
ema apron full of coals today and theyll comeback for another
the day after tomorrow as brazen as alabaster

the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible
simile and the beadle went on

in ever said mr bumble see anything like the pitch its got to
the day afore yesterday a man you have been a married woman ma am
and i may mention it to you a man with hardly a rag upon his back
here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door
when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be
relieved mrs corney a she wouldnt go away and shocked the company
very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a
pint of oatmeal my heart says the ungrateful villain whats the
use of this to me you might as well give me a pair of iron
spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again
you wont get anything else here then ill die in the streets
says the vagrant ohno you wont says our overseer

haha that was very good so like mr gran nett wasnt it
interposed the matron well mr bumble

well ma am rejoined the beadle he went away and he did die in
the streets theresa obstinate pauper for you

it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron
emphatically but dont you think out of door relief a very bad thing
anyway mr bumble your ea gentleman of experience and ought to
know come

mrs corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious
of superior information out of door relief properly managed
properly managed ma am is the p orochi al safeguard the great
principle of out of door relief is to give the paupers exactly what
they dont want and then they get tired of coming

dear me exclaimed mrs corney well that is a good one too

yes betwixt you and mem a am returned mr bumble thats the
great principle and thats the reason why if you look at any cases
that get into the mow da cious newspapers youll always observe that
sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese thats the rule
now mrs corney all over the country but however said the beadle
stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets ma am not
to be spoken of except as i may say among the p orochi al officers
such as ourselves this is the port wine ma am that the board ordered
for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask
this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment

having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to
test its excellence mr bumble placed them both on top of a chest of
drawers folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped put it
carefully in his pocket and took up his hat as if to go

youll have a very cold walk mr bumble said the matron

it blows ma am replied mr bumble turning up his coat collar
enough to cut one sears off

the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was
moving towards the door and as the beadle coughed preparatory to
bidding her goodnight bashfully inquired whether whether he wouldnt
take a cup of tea

mr bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again laid his hat
and stick upon a chair and drew another chair up to the table a she
slowly seated himself he looked at the lady she fixed here yes upon
the little teapot mr bumble coughed again and slightly smiled

mrs corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet as she
sat down here yes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle
she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea again
mr bumble coughed louder this time than he had coughed yet

sweet mr bumble inquired the matron taking up the sugar basin

very sweet indeed ma am replied mr bumble he fixed his eyes on
mrs corney a she said this and if ever a beadle looked tender mr
bumble was that beadle at that moment

the tea was made and handed in silence mr bumble having spread a
handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sul lying the
splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink varying these
amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh which however had
no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather
seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department

you have a cat ma am i see said mr bumble glancing at one who
in the centre of her family was basking before the fire and kittens
too i declare

i am so fond of them mr bumble you cant think replied the
matron they re so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that
they are quite companions for me

very nice animals ma am replied mr bumble approvingly so very
domestic

oh yes rejoined the matron with enthusiasm so fond of their home
too that its quite a pleasure im sure

mrs corney ma am said mr bumble slowly and marking the time
with his teaspoon i mean to say this ma am that any cat or kitten
that could live with you ma am and not be fond of its home must be
a ass ma am

oh mr bumble remonstrated mrs corney

its of no use disguising facts ma am said mr bumble slowly
flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him
doubly impressive i would drown it myself with pleasure

then your ea cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out
her hand for the beadles cup and a very hard hearted man besides

hard hearted ma am said mr bumble hard mr bumble resigned his
cup without another word squeezed mrs corney s little finger as she
took it and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat
gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther
from the fire

it was around table and as mrs corney and mr bumble had been
sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and
fronting the fire it will be seen that mr bumble in receding from
the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance
between himself and mrs corney which proceeding some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great
heroism on mr bumble spar the being in some sort tempted by time
place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft no things
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other
great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle who as is well known should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all

whatever were mr bumbles intentions however and no doubt they were
of the best it unfortunately happened as has been twice before
remarked that the table was around one consequently mr bumble
moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the
distance between himself and the matron and continuing to travel
round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close
to that in which the matron was seated

indeed the two chairs touched and when they did so mr bumble
stopped

now if the matron had moved her chair to the rights he would have
been scorched by the fire and if to the left she must have fallen
into mr bumbles arms so being a discreet matron and no doubt
foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was
and handed mr bumble another cup of tea

hard hearted mrs corney said mr bumble stirring his tea and
looking up into the matrons face are you hard hearted mrs
corney

dear me exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a
single man what can you want to know for mr bumble

the beadle drank his tea to the last drop finished a piece of toast
whisked the crumbs off his knees wiped his lips and deliberately
kissed the matron

mr bumble cried that discreet lady in a whisper for the fright was
so great that she had quite lost her voice mr bumble i shall
scream mr bumble made no reply but in as low and dignified manner
put his arm round the matrons waist

as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would
have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was
rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door which was no
sooner heard than mr bumble darted with much agility to the wine
bottles and began dusting them with great violence while the matron
sharply demanded who was there

it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy
of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that
her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity

if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously
ugly putting her head in at the door old sally is a going fast

well whats that to me angrily demanded the matron icant keep
her alive can i

no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can shes far
beyond the reach of help ive seen a many people die little babes and
great strongmen and i know when deaths a coming well enough but
shes troubled in her mind and when the fits are not on her and
thats not often for she is dying very hard she says she has got
something to tell which you must hear shell never die quiet till you
come mistress

at this intelligence the worthy mrs corney muttered a variety of
invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely
annoying their better sand muffling herself in a thick shawl which
she hastily caught up briefly requested mr bumble to stay till she
came back lest anything particular should occur bidding the messenger
walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs she followed
her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way

mr bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable
he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugar tongs
closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the
genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put
on his cocked hat corner wise and danced with much gravity four
distinct times round the table

having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off
the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his
back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact
inventory of the furniture




chapter xxiv
treats on a very poor subject but is a short one and maybe found of
importance in this history


it was no unfit messenger of death who had disturbed the quiet of the
matrons room her body was bent by age her limbs trembled with palsy
her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the grotesque
shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand

ala show few of natures faces are left alone to gladden us with their
beauty the cares and sorrows and hungering s of the world change
them as they change hearts and it is only when those passions sleep
and have lost their hold forever that the troubled clouds pass off
and leave heavens surface clear it is a common thing for the
countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to
subside into the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy and
settle into the very look of early life so calm so peaceful do they
grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by
the coffins side in a we and see the angel even upon earth

the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering
some indistinct answers to the chiding s of her companion being at
length compelled to pause for breath she gave the light into her hand
and remained behind to follow as she might while the more nimble
superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay

it was a bare garret room with a dim light burning at the farther end
there was another old woman watching by the bed the parish
apothecary s apprentice was standing by the firemaking a toothpick
out of a quill

cold night mrs corney said this young gentleman as the matron
entered

very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil
tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke

you should get better coals out of your contractors said the
apothecary s deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night

they re the boards choosing sir returned the matron the least
they could do would be to keep us pretty warm for our places are hard
enough

the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman

oh said the youngman turning his face towards the bed as if he
had previously quite forgotten the patient its all up there mrs
corney

it is is it sir asked the matron

if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the
apothecary s apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point its a
breakup of the system altogether is she dozing old lady

the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain and nodded in the
affirmative

then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said
the youngman put the light on the floor she wont see it there

the attendant did as she was told shaking her head meanwhile to
intimate that the woman would not die so easily having done so she
resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time
returned the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped
herself in her shaw landsat at the foot of the bed

the apothecary s apprentice having completed the manufacture of the
toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
for ten minutes or so when apparently growing rather dull he wished
mrs corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe

when they had satin silence for sometime the two old women rose from
the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to
catch the heat the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled
faces and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position
they began to converse in a low voice

did she say anymore an ny dear while i was gone inquired the
messenger

not a word replied the other she plucked and to re at her arms for
a little time but i held her hands and she soon dropped off she
hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet i a int so
weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance no no

did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have demanded
the first

i tried to get it down rejoined the other but her teeth were tight
set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do
to get it back again so i drank it and it did me good

looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard
the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily

i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done
the same and made rare fun of it afterwards

ay that she would rejoined the other she had a merry heart a
many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as
waxwork my old eyes have seen the may and those old hands touched
them too for i have helped her scores of times

stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature
shook them exulting ly before her face and fumbling in her pocket
brought out an old time discoloured tin snuff box from which she shook
a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few
more into her own while they were thus employed the matron who had
been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her
stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to
wait

not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her
face we have none of us long to wait for death patience patience
hell be here soon enough for us all

hold your tongue you doting idiot said the matron sternly you
martha tell me has she been in this way before

often answered the first woman

but will never be again added the second one that is shell never
wake again but once and mind mistress that wont be for long

long or short said the matron snappish lys he wont find me here
when she does wake take care both of you how you worry me again for
nothing its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house
die and i wont thats more mind that you impudent old harri dans if
you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you

she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned
towards the bed caused her to look round the patient had raised
herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them

whos that she cried in a hollow voice

hush hush said one of the women stooping over her lie down lie
down

ill never lie down again alive said the woman struggling i
will tell her come here nearer let me whisper in you rear

she clutched the matron by the armand forcing her into a chair by the
bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of
the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners

turn them away said the woman drowsily make haste make haste

the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous
lamentations that the poor dear was to of arg one to know her best
friends and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never
leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the
door and returned to the bedside on being excluded the old ladies
changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was
drunk which indeed was not unlikely since in addition to a
moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring
under the effects of a final taste of g in and water which had been
privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy
old ladies themselves

now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great
effort to revive one latent spark of energy in this very room in this
very bed i once nursed a pretty young cree tur that was brought into
the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all soiled
with dust and blood she gave birth to a boy and died let me
think what was the year again

nevermind the year said the impatient auditor what about her

ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state
what about her what about i know she cried jumping fiercely up
her face flushed and here yes starting from her head i robbed her so
i did she wasnt cold i tell you she wasnt cold when i stole it

stole what for gods sake cried the matron with a gesture as if
she would call for help

it replied the woman laying her handover the others mouth the
only things he had she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to
eat but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom it was gold i
tell you rich gold that might have saved her life

gold echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell
back go on go on yes what of it who was the mother when was it

she charged me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and
trusted me as the only woman about her i stole it inmyheart when she
first showed it me hanging round her neck and the childs death
perhaps is on me besides they would have treated him better if they
had known it all

known what asked the other speak

the boy grew so like his mother said the woman rambling on and not
heeding the question that i could never forget it when i saw his
face poor girl poor girls he was so young too such a gentle lamb
wait theres more to tell i have not told you all have i

no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as
they came more faintly from the dying woman be quick or it maybe
too late

the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than before
the mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in
m year that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come
when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
named and oh kind heaven she said folding her thin hands
together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child
abandoned to its mercy

the boys name demanded the matron

they called him oliver replied the woman feebly the gold i
stole was

yes yes what cried the other

she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply but drew
back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a
sitting posture then clutching the cover lid with both hands muttered
some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell life lesson the bed


stone dead said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the
door was opened

and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking
carelessly away

the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the
preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left
alone hovering about the body




chapter xxv
where in this history reverts to mr fagin and company


while these things were passing in the country workhouse mr fagin sat
in the old den the same from which oliver had been removed by the
girl brooding over a dull smoky fire he held a pair of bellows upon
his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it
into more cheerful action but he had fallen into deep thought and
with his arms folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed
his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars

at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and
mr chit ling all intent upon a game of whist the artful taking dummy
against masterbates and mr chit ling the countenance of the
first named gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired
great additional interest from his close observance of the game and
his attentive perusal of mr chit lings hand upon which from time to
time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances
wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon
his neighbours cards it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat
as indeed was often his custom with indoor she also sustained a clay
pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space when he
deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the
table which stood ready filled with g in and water for the
accommodation of the company

masterbates was also attentive to the play but being of a more
excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that
he more frequently applied himself to the g in and water and moreover
indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a
scientific rubber indeed the artful presuming upon their close
attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his
companion upon these improprieties all of which remonstrances master
bates received in extremely good part merely requesting his friend to
be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some
other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind the happy application
of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr chit ling
it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably
lost and that the circumstances of ar from angering masterbates
appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch a she laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had
never seen such a jolly game in all his born days

thats two doubles and the rub said mr chit ling with a very long
face a she drew half a crown from his waistcoat pocket in ever see
such a feller as you jack you win everything even when weve good
cards charley and icant make nothing of em

either the master or the manner of this remark which was made very
ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of
laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire
what was the matter

matter fagin cried charley i wish you had watched the play tommy
chit ling hasnt won a point and i went partners with him against the
art full and dumb

a yay said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated
that he was at no loss to understand the reason try em again tom
try em again

no more of it for me thank ee fagin replied mr chit lin give
had enough that ere dodger has such a run of luck that theres no
standing again him

haha my dear replied the jew you must get up very early in the
morning to win against the dodger

morning said charley bates you must put your boots on overnight
and have a telescope at each eye and a opera glass between your
shoulders if you want to come over him

mr dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy
and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first
picture car data shilling at a time nobody accepting the challenge
and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to am use
himself by sketching a ground plan of newgate on the table with the
piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters whistling
meantime with peculiar shrillness

how precious dull you are tommy said the dodger stopping short
when there had been along silence and addressing mr chit ling what
do you think hes thinking of fagin

how should i know my dear replied the jew looking round a she
plied the bellows about his losses maybe or the little retirement
in the country that hes just left eh haha is that it my dear

not abit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of
discourse as mr chit ling was about to reply what do you say
charley

i should say replied masterbates with a grin that he was
uncommon sweet upon betsy see how hesa blushing oh my eye heres
a merrygoround er tommy chit lings in love oh fagin fagin what a
spree

thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr chit ling being the victim
of the tender passion masterbates threw himself back in his chair
with such violence that he los this balance and pitched over upon the
floor where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at
full length until his laugh was over when he resumed his former
position and began another laugh

nevermind him my dear said the jew winking at mr dawkins and
giving masterbates are proving tap with the nozzle of the bellows
betsy sa fine girl stick up to her tom stick up to her

what i mean to say fagin replied mr chit ling very red in the
face is that that isnt anything to anybody here

no more it is replied the jew charley will talk dont mind him
my dear dont mind him betsy sa fine girl do as she bids you tom
and you will make your fortune

so i do do as she bids me replied mr chit ling i shouldnt have
been milled if it hadnt been for her advice but it turned out a good
job for you didnt it fagin and whats six weeks of it it must
come sometime or another and why not in the wintertime when you
dont want to go out a walking so much eh fagin

ah to be sure my dear replied the jew

you wouldnt mind it again tom would you asked the dodger winking
upon charley and the jew if bet was all right

i mean to say that i shouldnt replied tom angrily there now
ah who ll say as much as that i should like to know eh fagin

nobody my dear replied the jew not a soul to mi dont know one
of em that would do it besides you not one of emmy dear

i might have got clear off if id split upon her might nti fagin
angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe a word from me would have
done it wouldnt it fagin

to be sure it would my dear replied the jew

but i didnt blab it did i fagin demanded tom pouring question
upon question with great volu bility

no no to be sure replied the jew you were too stout hearted for
that a deal too stout my dear

perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round and if i was whats to
laugh at in that eh fagin

the jew perceiving that mr chit ling was considerably roused hastened
to assure him that nobody was laughing and to prove the gravity of the
company appealed to masterbates the principal offender but
unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never
more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a
violent roar that the abused mr chit ling without any preliminary
ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender
who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose
his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood
panting for breath while mr chit ling looked on in intense dismay

hark cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler
catching up the light he crept softly upstairs

the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in
darkness after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered
fagin mysteriously

what cried the jew alone

the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the
candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb
show that he had better not be funny just then having performed this
friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his
directions

the oldman bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds his
face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and
feared to know the worst at length he raised his head

where is hehe asked

the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to
leave the room

yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry bring him down hush
quiet charley gently tom scarce scarce

this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist was
softly and immediately obeyed there was no sound of their where about
when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand
and followed by a man in a coarse smock frock who after casting a
hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had
concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosed all haggard
unwashed and uns horn the features of flash to by crack it

how are you f ague y said this worthy nodding to the jew pop that
shawl away in my castor dodgers o that i may know where to find it
when i cut thats the timeofday youll be a fine young cracks man
afore the old file now

with these words he pulled up the smock frock and winding it round
his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob

see the ref ague y he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots
not a drop of day and martin since you know when not a bubble of
blacking by jove but dont look at me in that wayman all in good
time icant talkabout business til live eat and drank so produce
the sustain ance and lets have a quiet fill out for the first time
these three days

the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon
the table and seating himself opposite the house breaker waited his
leisure

to judge from appearances to by was by no means in a hurry to open the
conversation at first the jew contented himself with patiently
watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue
to the intelligence he brought but in vain

he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon
his features that they always wore and through dirt and beard and
whisker there still shone unimpaired the self satisfied smirk of
flash to by crack it then the jew in an agony of impatience watched
every morsel he put into his mouth pacing up and down the room
meanwhile in irrepressible excitement it was all of no use to by
continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could
eat no more then ordering the dodger out he closed the door mixed a
glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking

first and foremost f ague y said to by

yes yes interposed the jew drawing up his chair

mr crack it stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to
declare that the g in was excellent then placing his feet against the
low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his
eye he quietly resumed

first and foremost f ague y said the house breaker how s bill

what screamed the jew starting from his seat

why you dont mean to say began to by turning pale

mean cried the jew stamping furiously on the ground where are
they sikes and the boy where are they where have they been where
are they hiding why have they not been here

the crack failed said to by faintly

i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his pocket and
pointing to it what more

they fired and hit the boy we cutover the fields at the back with
him between us straight as the crow flies through hedge and ditch they
gave chase damme the whole country was awake and the dogs upon us

the boy

bill had him on his back and scud ded like the wind we stopped to
take him between us his head hung down and he was cold they were
close upon our heels everyman for himself and each from the gallows
we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch alive or
dead that salli know about him

the jew stopped to hear no more but uttering aloud yell and twining
his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house




chapter xxvi
in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene and many
things inseparable from this history are done and performed


the oldman had gained the street corner before he began to recover
the effect of to by crack its intelligence he had relaxed nothing of
his unusual speed but was still pressing onward in the same wild and
disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage and a
boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger drove him
backup on the pavement avoiding as much as was possible all the main
streets and skulking only through the by ways and alleys heat length
emerged on snow hill here he walked even faster than before nor did
he linger until he had again turned into a court when as if conscious
that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual shuffling
pace and seemed to breathe more freely

near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon
the righthand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley
leading to saffron hill in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns
for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the
windows or flaunting from the doorposts and the shelves within are
piled with them confined as the limits of field lane are it has its
barber its coffeeshop its beer shop and its fried fish warehouse
it is a commercial colony of itself the emporium of petty larceny
visited at early morning and setting in of dusk by silent merchants
who traffic in dark back parlours and who go as strangely as they
come here the clothes man the shoe v am per and the rag merchant
display their goods assign boards to the petty thief here stores of
old iron and bones and heaps of mildew y fragments of woollen stuff and
linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars

it was into this place that the jew turned he was well known to the
sallow denizens of the lane for such of them as were on the lookout
to buy or sell nodded familiarly a she passed along he replied to
their salutations in the same way but bestowed no closer recognition
until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to
address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his
person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a
pipe a this warehouse door

why the sight of you mr fagin would cure the hop talmy said this
respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his
health

the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating
his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders

well ive he erd that complaint of it once or twice before replied
the trader but it soon cools down again dont you find it so

fagin nodded in the affirmative pointing in the direction of saffron
hill he inquired whether anyone was up yonder tonight

at the cripples inquired the man

the jew nodded

let me see pursued the merchant reflecting

yes theres some half dozen of em gone in that i knows i dont
think your friends there

sikes is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed
countenance

non ist went us as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking
his head and looking amazingly sly have you got anything in my line
tonight

nothing tonight said the jew turning away

are you going up to the cripples fagin cried the little man
calling after him stop i dont mind if i have a drop there with
you

but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he
preferred being alone and moreover as the little man could not very
easily disengage himself from the chair the sign of the cripples was
for a time bereft of the advantage of mr lively s presence by the
time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared so mr lively
after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight
of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a
shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and
mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour

the three cripples or rather the cripples which was the sign by which
the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons was the
public house in which mr sikes and his dog have already figured
merely making a sign to amanat the bar fagin walked straight
upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating
himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his eyes with
his hand as if in search of some particular person

the room was illuminated by two gas lights the glare of which was
prevented by the barred shutters and closely drawn curtains of faded
red from being visible outside the ceiling was blackened to prevent
its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps and the
place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely
possible to discern anything more by degrees however as some of it
cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused
as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out and as the eye
grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware
of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a
long table at the upper end of which sata chairman with a hammer of
office in his hand while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose
and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache preside data
jingling piano in a remote corner

as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over
the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a
song which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the
company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the
accompany ist played the melody all through as loud a she could when
this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the
professional gentleman on the chairmans right and left volunteered a
duet and sang it with great applause

it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
among the group there was the chairman himself the landlord of the
house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were
proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give
himself up to jovial ity had an eye for everything that was done and
a near for everything that was said and sharp ones too near him were
the singers receiving with professional indifference the compliments
of the company and applying themselves in turn to a dozen proffered
glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more boisterous
admirers whose countenances expressive of almost every vice in almost
every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by their very
repulsive ness cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its stages
were there in their strongest aspect and women some with the last
lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked
others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out and
presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime some mere
girls others but young women and none past the prime of life formed
the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture

fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face
while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without
meeting that of which he was in search succeeding at length in
catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him
slightly and left the room as quietly a she had entered it

what can i do for you mr fagin inquired the man a she followed
him out to the landing wont you join us theyll be delighted every
one of em

the jews hook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he
here

no replied the man

and no news of barney inquired fagin

none replied the landlord of the cripples for it was hehe wont
stir till its all safe depend on it they re on the scent down there
and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once hes all right
enough barney is else i should have heard of him ill pound it that
barneys managing properly let him alone for that

will he be here tonight asked the jew laying the same emphasis
on the pronoun as before

monks do you mean inquired the landlord hesitating

hush said the jew yes

certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob i
expected him here before now if youll wait ten minutes hell be

no no said the jew hastily as though however desirous he might
be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me
tonight no say tomorrow a she is not here tomorrow will be time
enough

good said the man nothing more

not a word now said the jew descending the stairs

i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a
hoarse whisper what a time this would be for as el live got phil
barker here so drunk that a boy might take him

ah but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up phil
has something more to do before we can afford to part with him so go
back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry lives while
they last hahaha

the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh and returned to his
guests the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its
former expression of anxiety and thought after a brief reflection he
called a hack cabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of mr sikes s
residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot

now muttered the je was he knocked at the door if there is any
deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you
are

she was in her room the woman said fagin crept softly upstairs and
entered it without any previous ceremony the girl was alone lying
with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it

she has been drinking thought the jew cooly or perhaps she is
only miserable

the oldman turned to close the door a she made this reflection the
noise thus occasioned roused the girls he eyed his crafty face
narrowly as she inquired to his recital of to by crack its story when
it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a
words he pushed the candle impatiently away and once or twice as she
feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground but
this was all

during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to
assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly
returned apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice or
thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation but the girl
heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone at length he made
another attempt and rubbing his hands together said in his most
conciliatory tone

and where should you think bill was now my dear

the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not
tell and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be
crying

and the boy too said the jews training his eyes to catch a glimpse
of her face poor leetle child left in a ditch nance only think

the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he
is than among us and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies
dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there

what cried the jew in amazement

ayi do returned the girl meeting his gaze i shall be glad to
have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over icant
bear to have him about me the sight of him turns me against myself
and all of you

pooh said the jew scornfully you re drunk

am i cried the girl bitterly its no fault of yours if i am not
you d never have me anything elseif you had your will except
now the humour doesnt suit you doesnt it

no rejoined the jew furiously it does not

change it then responded the girl with a laugh

change it exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his
companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i
will change it listen to me you drab listen to me who with six
words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat
between my fingers now if he comes back and leaves the boy behind
him if he gets off free and dead or alive fail store store him to
me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch and do
it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too
late

what is all this cried the girl involuntarily

what is it pursued fagin mad with rage when the boys worth
hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way
of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could
whistle away the lives of and me bound too to a born devil that only
wants the will and has the power to to

panting for breath the oldman stammered for a word and in that
instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole
demeanour a moment before his clenched hands had grasped the air his
eyes had dilated and his face grown livid with passion but now he
shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the
apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy after a
short silence he ventured to look round a this companion he appeared
somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from
which he had first roused her

nancy dear croaked the jew in his usual voice did you mind me
dear

dont worry me now fagin replied the girl raising her head
languidly if bill has not done it this time he will another he has
done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and
when he can the wont sono more about that

regarding this boy my dear said the jew rubbing the palms of his
hands nervously together

the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy
hastily and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way
and out of yours that is if bill comes to no harm and if to by got
clear off bills pretty sure to be safe for bills worth two of to by
anytime

and about what i was saying my dear observed the jew keeping his
glistening eye steadily upon her

you must say it all over again if its anything you want metodo
rejoined nancy and if it is you had better wait till tomorrow you
put me up for a minute but now im stupid again

fag input several other questions all with the same drift of
ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints but
she answered them so readily and was with also utterly unmoved by his
searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a
trifle in liquor was confirmed nancy indeed was not exempt from a
failing which was very common among the jews female pupils and in
which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than
checked her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva
which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of
the justice of the jews supposition and when after indulging in the
temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into
dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings under the
influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave
utterance to various exclamations of never say die and divers
calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a
lady or gentleman was happy mr fagin who had had considerable
experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction
that she was very far gone indeed

having eased his mind by this discovery and having accomplished his
twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard
and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned
mr fagin again turned his face homeward leaving his young friend
asleep with her head upon the table

it was within an hour of midnight the weather being dark and piercing
cold he had no great temptation to loiter the sharp wind that scoured
the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as of dust and
mud for few people were abroad and they were to all appearance
hastening fast home it blew from the right quarter for the jew
however and straight before i the went trembling and shivering as
every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way

he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling
in his pocket for the door key when a dark figure emerged from a
projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road
glided up to him unperceived

fagin whispered a voice close to his ear

ah said the jew turning quickly round is that

yes interrupted the stranger i have been lingering here these two
hours where the devil have you been

on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily a this
companion and slackening hi space a she spoke on your business all
night

oh of course said the stranger with a sneer well and whats
come of it

nothing good said the jew

nothing bad i hope said the stranger stopping short and turning a
startled look on his companion

the jews hook his head and was about to reply when the stranger
interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this
time arrived remarking that he had better say what he had got to say
undercover for his blood was chilled withstanding about so long and
the wind blew through him

fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking
home a visitor at that unseasonable hour and indeed muttered
something about having no fire but his companion repeating his request
in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to
close it softly while he got a light

its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps
make haste

shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage a she
spoke it closed with aloud noise

that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way the wind
blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp
with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in
this confounded hole

fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs after a short absence
he returned with alighted candle and the intelligence that to by
crack it was asleep in the backroom below and that the boys were in
the front one beckoning the man to follow him he led the way
upstairs

we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the
jew throwing open a door on the first floor and as there are holes
in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours well set
the candle on the stairs there

with those words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper
flight of stairs exactly opposite to the room door this done he led
the way into the apartment which was destitute of all movables save a
broken armchair and an old couch or sofa without covering which
stood behind the door upon this piece of furniture the strangers at
himself with the air of a weary man and the jew drawing up the
armchair opposite they sat face to face it was not quite dark the
door was partially open and the candle outside threw a feeble
reflection on the opposite wall

they conversed for sometime in whispers though nothing of the
conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be
defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the
latter was in a state of considerable irritation they might have been
talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monks by which
name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course
of their colloquy said raising his voice a little

i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here
among there stand made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at
once

only hear him exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders

why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen
demanded monks sternly havent you done it with other boys scores
of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt
you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps
for life

whose turn would that have served my dear inquired the jew humbly

mine replied monks

but not mine said the jew submissively he might have become of
use to me when there are two parties to a bargain it is only
reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my
good friend

what then demanded monks

i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew
he was not like other boys in the same circumstances

curse him no muttered the manor he would have been a thief long
ago

i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously
watching the countenance of his companion his hand was not in i had
nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the
beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the
dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i
trembled for us all

that was not my doing observed monks

no no my dear renewed the jew and i dont quarrel with it now
because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on
the boy to notice him and soled to the discovery that it was him you
were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl
and then she begins to favour him

throttle the girl said monks impatiently

why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew
smiling and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one
of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls
are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden shell care no
more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if
he is alive i can make him one from this time and if if said the
jew drawing nearer to the other its not likely mind but if the
worst comes to the worst and he is dead

its no fault of mine if he is interposed the other man with a look
of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands mind that
fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death it old you from the
first i wont shed blood its always found out and haunts a man
besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me
fire this infernal den whats that

what cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both
arms a she sprung to his feet where

yonder replied the man glaring at the opposite wall the shadow i
saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet passalong the
wainscot like a breath

the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuous ly from the room
the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been
placed it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white
faces they listened intently a profound silence reigned throughout
the house

its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his
companion

ill swear i saw it replied monks trembling it was bending
forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away

the jew glanced contemptuously at the paleface of his associate and
telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs they
looked into all the rooms they were cold bare and empty they
descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below the
green damp hung upon the low walls the tracks of the snail and slug
glistened in the light of the candle but all was still as death

what do you think now said the jew when they had regained the
passage besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house except
to by and the boys and they re safe enough see here

as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket
and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them
into prevent any intrusion on the conference

this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks his
protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
proceeded in their search without making any discovery and now he
gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have
been his excited imagination he declined any renewal of the
conversation however for that night suddenly remembering that it was
past one oclock and so the amiable couple parted




chapter xxvii
a tones for the un politeness of a former chapter which deserted a lady
most unceremoniously


as it would be by no means seemly in a humble author to keep so
mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and
the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as
it might suit his pleasure to relieve him and as it would still less
become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming
from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of
whatsoever degree the historian whose pen traces these words trusting
that he knows his place and that he entertains a becoming reverence
for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is
delegated hastens to pay them that respect which their position
demands and to treat them with all that du teo us ceremony which their
exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at
his hands towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in
this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and
e lucida tive of the position that a beadle can do no wrong which could
not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of
time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
opportunity on the arrival of which he will be prepared to show that
a beadle properly constituted that is to say a parochial beadle
attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official
capacity the parochial church is in right and virtue of his office
possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity and
that to none of those excellence scan mere companies beadles or
court of law beadles or even chapel of ease beadles save the last
and they in a very lowly and inferior degree lay the remotest
sustainable claim

mr bumble had recounted the teaspoons re weighed the sugar tongs
made a closer inspection of the milk pot and ascertained to a nicety
the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horsehair seats
of the chairs and had repeated each process full half a dozen times
before he began to think that it was time for mrs corney to return
thinking be gets thinking as there were no sounds of mrs corney s
approach it occured to mr bumble that it would bean innocent and
virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his
curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of mrs corney s chest
of drawers

having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was
approaching the chamber mr bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded
to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers
which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture
carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with
dried lavender seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction arriving
in course of time at the righthand corner drawer in which was the
key and beholding there in a small padlocked box which being shaken
gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chin king of coin mr bumble
returned with a stately walk to the fireplace and resuming his old
attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do i the
followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a
waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were re monst rating with
himself for being such a pleasant dog and then he took a view of his
legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest

he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when mrs corney
hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a
chair by the fireside and covering here yes with one hand placed the
other over her heart and gasped for breath

mrs corney said mr bumble stooping over the matron what is
this ma am has anything happened ma am pray answer me i mon on
mr bumble in his alarm could not immediately think of the word
tenterhooks so he said broken bottles

oh mr bumble cried the lady i have been so dreadfully put out

put out ma am exclaimed mr bumble who has dared to i know
said mr bumble checking himself with native majesty this is them
w icious paupers

its dreadful to think of said the lady shuddering

then dont think of it ma am rejoined mr bumble

icant help it whimpered the lady

then take something ma am said mr bumble soothingly a little of
the wine

not for the world replied mrs corney i couldnt oh the top
shelf in the righthand corner oh uttering these words the good lady
pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion from
internal spasms mr bumble rushed to the closet and snatching a pint
green glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated filled a
teacup with its contents and held it to the lady slips

im better now said mrs corney falling back after drinking half
of it

mr bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness and
bringing them down again to the brim of the c uplifted it to his nose

peppermint exclaimed mrs corney in a faint voice smiling gently
on the beadle as she spoke try it theresa little a little
something else in it

mr bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look smacked his lips
took another taste and put the cup down empty

its very comforting said mrs corney

very much so indeed ma am said the beadle a she spoke he drew a
chair beside the matron and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her

nothing replied mrs corney i am a foolish excitable weak
cree tur

not weak ma am retorted mr bumble drawing his chair a little
closer are you a weak cree tur mrs corney

we are all weak cree tur s said mrs corney laying down a general
principle

so we are said the beadle

nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards by the
expiration of that time mr bumble had illustrated the position by
removing his left arm from the back of mrs corney s chair where it
had previously rested to mrs corney s apron string round which it
gradually became entwined

we are all weak cree tur s said mr bumble

mrs corney sighed

dont sigh mrs corney said mr bumble

icant help it said mrs corney and she sighed again

this is a very comfortable room ma am said mr bumble looking
round another room and this ma am would be a complete thing

it would be too much for one murmured the lady

but not for two ma am rejoined mr bumble in soft accents eh
mrs corney

mrs corney drooped her head when the beadle said this the beadle
drooped his to get a view of mrs corney s face mrs corney with
great propriety turned her head away and released her hand to get at
her pocket handkerchief but insensibly replaced it in that of mr
bumble

the board allows you coals dont they mrs corney inquired the
beadle affectionately pressing her hand

and candles replied mrs corney slightly returning the pressure

coals candles and house rent free said mr bumble oh mrs
corney what an angel you are

the lady was not proof against this burst of feelings he sank into mr
bumbles arms and that gentleman in his agitation imprinted a
passionate kiss upon her chaste nose

such p orochi al perfection exclaimed mr bumble rapturously you
know that mrs l out is worse tonight my fascinator

yes replied mrs corney bashfully

he cant live a week the doctor says pursued mr bumble he is the
master of this establishment his death will cause awa can cy that
wa can cy must be filled up oh mrs corney what a prospect this opens
what a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeeping s

mrs corney sobbed

the little word said mr bumble bending over the bashful beauty
the one little little little word my blessed corney

yey eyes sighed out the matron

one more pursued the beadle compose your darling feelings for only
one more when is it to come off

mrs corney twice essayed to speak and twice failed at length
summoning up courage she threw her arms around mr bumbles neck and
said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a
irresistible duck

matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract
was solemnly ratified in another tea cupful of the peppermint mixture
which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of
the ladys spirits while it was being disposed of she acquainted mr
bumble with the old womans decease

very good said that gentleman sipping his peppermint ill call at
sower berry sasi go home and tell him to send tomorrow morning was
it that as frightened you love

it wasnt anything particular dear said the lady evasively

it must have been something love urged mr bumble wont you tell
your own b

not now rejoined the lady one of these days after were married
dear

after were married exclaimed mr bumble it wasnt any impudence
from any of them male paupers as

no no love interposed the lady hastily

if i thought it was continued mr bumble if i thought as anyone
of em had dared to lift his wu lg are yes to that lovely countenance

they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the lady

they had better not said mr bumble clenching his fist let me see
any man p orochi a lorex trap orochi alas would presume to do it and i
can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second time

un embellished by any violence of gest i culation this might have seemed
no very high compliment to the ladys charms but as mr bumble
accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched
with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration
that he was indeed a dove

the dove then turned up his coat collar and put on his cocked hat
and having exchanged along and affectionate embrace with his future
partner once again braved the cold wind of the night merely pausing
for a few minutes in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little
with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of
work housemaster with needful acer bit y assured of his qualifications
mr bumble left the building with a light heart and bright visions of
his future promotion which served to occupy his mind until he reached
the shop of the undertaker

now mr and mrs sower berry having gone out to tea and supper and
noah clay pole not being at anytime disposed to take upon himself a
greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient
performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was
not closed although it was past the usual hour of shutting up mr
bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times but
attracting no attention and beholding a light shining through the
glass window of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made
bold to peep in and see what was going forward and when he saw what
was going forward he was not a little surprised

the cloth was laid for supper the table was covered with bread and
butter plates and glasses a porter pot and a wine bottle at the
upper end of the table mr noah clay pole lolled negligently in an
easy chair with his legs thrown over one of the arms an open
clasp knife in one hand and a mass of buttered bread in the other
close beside him stood charlotte opening oysters from a barrel which
mr clay pole condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity a more
than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and
a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in as light
degree intoxicated these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish
with which he took his oysters for which nothing but a strong
appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever
could have sufficiently accounted

here sa delicious fat one noah dear said charlotte try him do
only this one

what a delicious thing is a oyster remarked mr clay pole after he
had swallowed it what a pity it is a number of em should ever make
you feel uncomfortable isnt it charlotte

its quite a cruelty said charlotte

so it is acquiesced mr clay pole an tyer fond of oysters

not over much replied charlotte i like to see you eat em noah
dear better than eating em myself

l or said noah reflectively how queer

have another said charlotte heres one with such a beautiful
delicate beard

icant manage anymore said no a him very sorry come here
charlotte and ill kiss yer

what said mr bumble bursting into the room say that again sir

charlotte uttered as cream and hid her face in her apron mr
clay pole without making any further change in his position than
suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken
terror

say it again you wi leowd a cious fellow said mr bumble how dare
you mention such a thing sir and how dare you encourage him you
insolent minx kiss her exclaimed mr bumble in strong indignation
fa ugh

i didnt mean to do it said noah blubbering shes always
a kissing of me whether i like it or not

oh noah cried charlotte reproachfully

yer are yer know yer are retorted noah shes always a do in of
it mr bumble sir she chucks me under the chin please sir and
makes all manner of love

silence cried mr bumble sternly take yourself downstairs ma am
noah you shutup the shop say another word till your master comes
home at your peril and when he does come home tell him that mr
bumble said he was to send a old womans shell after breakfast
tomorrow morning do you hear sir kissing cried mr bumble holding
up his hands the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this
p orochi al district is frightful if parliament dont take their
abominable courses under consideration this country s ruined and the
character of the peasantry gone forever with these words the beadle
strode with a lofty and gloomy air from the undertakers premises

and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have
made all necessary preparations for the old womans funeral let us set
on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist and ascertain whether
he be still lying in the ditch where to by crack it left him




chapter xxviii
looks after oliver and proceeds with his adventures


wolves tear your throats muttered sikes grinding his teeth i wish
i was among some of you you d howl the hoarse r for it

as sikes growled forth this im pre cation with the most desperate
ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body
of the wounded boy across his bended knee and turned his head for an
instant to look back a this pursuers

there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness but the loud
shouting of men vibrated through the air and the barking of the
neighbouring dogs roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in
every direction

stop you white live red hound cried the robber shouting after to by
crack it who making the best use of his longlegs was already ahead
stop

the repetition of the word brought to by to a dead standstill for he
was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistols hot
and sikes was in no mood to be played with

bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his
confederate comeback

to by made a show of returning but ventured in a low voice broken for
want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance a she came slowly
along

quicker cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch a this feet and
drawing a pistol from his pocket dont play booty with me

at this moment the noise grew louder sikes again looking round could
discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate
of the field in which he stood and that a couple of dogs were some
paces in advance of them

its all up bill cried to by drop the kid and show em your
heels with this parting advice mr crack it preferring the chance of
being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his
enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed sikes
clenched his teeth took one look around threw over the prostrate form
of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along
the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those
behind from the spot where the boy lay paused for a second before
another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol
high into the air cleared it at abound and was gone

hoho there cried a tremulous voice in the rear pincher
neptune come here come here

the dogs who in common with their masters seemed to have no
particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily
answered to the command three men who had by this time advanced some
distance into the field stopped to take counsel together

my advice or least ways i should say my orders is said the
fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again

i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles said a
shorter man who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very
pale in the face and very polite as frightened men frequently are

i shouldnt wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen said the third
who had called the dogs back mr giles ought to know

certainly replied the shorter man and whatever mr giles says it
isnt our place to contradict him no no i know my siti wa tion thank
my stars i know my siti wa tion to tell the truth the little man
did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that it
was by no means a desirable one for his teeth chattered in his head as
he spoke

you are afraid brittle s said mr giles

i ant said brittle s

you are said giles

your ea falsehood mr giles said brittle s

you real ie brittle s said mr giles

now these four retorts arose from mr giles st aunt and mr gi less
taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of
going home again imposed upon himself undercover of a compliment the
third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically

ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid

speak for yourself sir said mr giles who was the palest of the
party

so i do replied the man its natural and proper to be afraid
under such circumstances i am

so am i said brittle s only theres no call to tell a man he is so
bounce ably

these frank admissions softened mr giles who at once owned that he
was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again
with the complete st unanimity until mr giles who had the shortest
wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely
insisted on stopping to make an apology for his has tines s of speech

but its wonderful said mr giles when he had explained what a
man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i
know i should if wed caught one of them rascals

as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and as
their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament

i know what it was said mr giles it was the gate

i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittle s catching at the
idea

you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow
of the excitement i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was
climbing over it

by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the
same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment it was quite obvious
therefore that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt
regarding the time at which the change had taken place because all
three remembered that they had come insight of the robbers at the
instant of its occurance

this dialogue was held between the t women who had surprised the
burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an out house
and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in
the pursuit mr giles acted in the double capacity of butler and
steward to the old lady of the mansion brittle swa salad of all work
who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a
promising youngboy still though he was something past thirty

encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very
close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round
whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three men hurried
back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern les tits
light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire catching up
the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot
and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the
light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like
some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was
swiftly borne

the air grew colder as day came slowly on and the mist rolled along
the ground like a dense cloud of smoke the grass was wet the
pathways and low places were all mire and water the damp breath of
an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning still
oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left
him

morning drew on a pace the air become more sharp and piercing as its
first dull hue the death of night rather than the birth of
day glimmered faintly in the sky the objects which had looked dim and
terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually
resolved into their familiar shapes the rain came down thick and
fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes but oliver felt
it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless
and unconscious on his bed of clay

at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and
uttering it the boy awoke his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl
hung heavy and useless a this side the bandage was saturated with
blood he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a
sitting posture when he had done so he looked feebly round for help
and groaned with pain trembling in every joint from cold and
exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from
head to foot fell prostrate on the ground

after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long
plunged oliver urged by a creeping sickness a this heart which
seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely diego t upon
his feet and essayed to walk his head was dizzy and he staggered to
and fro like a drunken man but he kept up nevertheless and with his
head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew
not whither

and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his
mind he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crack it who were
angrily disputing for the very words they said sounded in his ears
and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some
violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was
talking to them then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the
previous day and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers
grasp upon his wrist suddenly he started back at the report of
firearms there rose into the air loud cries and shouts lights
gleamed before his eyes all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand
bore him hurriedly away through all these rapid visions there ran an
undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented
him incessantly

thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars
of gates or through hedge gaps as they came in his way until he
reached a road here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused
him

he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house
which perhaps he could reach pitying his condition they might have
compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he thought
to die near human beings than in the lonely open field she summoned
up all his strength for one last trial and ben this faltering steps
towards it

a she drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had
seen it before he remembered nothing of its details but the shape and
aspect of the building seemed familiar to him

that garden wall on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last
night and prayed the two mens mercy it was the very house they had
attempted to rob

oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that
for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of
flightflight he could scarcely stand and if he were in full
possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame
whither could he fly he pushed against the garden gate it was
unlocked and swung open on its hinges he tottered across the lawn
climbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strength
failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little
portico

it happened that about this time mr giles brittle sand the tinker
were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the
night with tea and sundries in the kitchen not that it was mr
gi less habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants
towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty
affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of
his superior position in society but death fires and burglary make
all men equals so mr giles sat with his legs stretched out before the
kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while with his
right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the
robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid
who were of the party listened with breathless interest

it was about half past two said mr giles or i wouldnt swear that
it might nt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and
turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned
round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him
to imitate bedclothes i fancied i he erda noise

at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the
housemaid to shut the door who asked brittle s who asked the tinker
who pretended not to hear

he erda noise continued mr giles i says at first this is
illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i he erd the
noise again distinct

what sort of a noise asked the cook

a kind of a busting noise replied mr giles looking round him

more like the noise of powdering air on barona nutmeg grater
suggested brittle s

it was when you he erd it sir rejoined mr giles but at this
time it had a busting sound i turned down the clothes continued
giles rolling back the tablecloths at up in bed and listened

the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated l or and drew their
chairs closer together

i he erd it now quite apparent resumed mr giles somebody i
says is forcing of a door or window whats to bed oneill call up
that poor lad brittle sand save him from being murdered in his bed
or his throat i says maybe cut from his right ear to his left
without his ever knowing it

here all eyes we returned upon brittle s who fixed his upon the
speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face
expressive of the most unmitigated horror

i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth
and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of
bed drew on a pair of

ladies present mr giles murmured the tinker

of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great
emphasis on the word seized the loaded pistol that always goes
upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room
brittle si says when i had woke him dont be frightened

so you did observed brittle sina low voice

were dead men i think brittle si says continued giles but
dont be frightened

was he frightened asked the cook

not abit of it replied mr giles he was as firm ah pretty near
as firm as i was

i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the
housemaid

your ea woman retorted brittle s plucking up a little

brittle s is right said mr giles nodding his head approvingly
from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a
dark lantern that was standing on brittle sho band groped our way
downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so

mr giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes
shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he
started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried
back to his chair the cook and housemaid screamed

it was a knock said mr giles assuming perfect serenity open the
door somebody

nobody moved

it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in
the morning said mr giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him and looking very blank himself but the door must be opened do
you hear somebody

mr giles a she spoke looked at brittle s but that youngman being
naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that
the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he
tendered no reply mr giles directed an appealing glance at the
tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep the women were out of the
question

if brittle s would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses
said mr giles after a short silence i am ready to make one

so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly a she had fallen
asleep

brittle s capitulated on these terms and the party being somewhat
reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that
it was now broad day took their way upstairs with the dogs in front
the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear by
the advice of mr giles they all talked very loud to warn any
evil disposed person outside that they were strong in numbers and by
a master stoke of policy originating in the brain of the same
ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to
make them bark savagely

these precautions having been taken mr giles held on fast by the
tinkers arm to prevent his running away a she pleasantly said and
gave the word of command to open the door brittle s obeyed the group
peeping timor ously over each others shoulders beheld no more
formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and
exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their
compassion

a boy exclaimed mr giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the
background whats the matter with the eh why brittle s look
here dont you know

brittle s who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver
than he uttered aloud cry mr giles seizing the boy by one leg and
one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the
hall and deposited him at full length on the floor there of

here he is bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up
the staircase heres one of the thieves ma am here sa thief miss
wounded miss is hot him miss and brittle s held the light

in a lantern miss cried brittle s applying one hand to the side of
his mouth so that his voice might travel the better

the two women servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr
giles had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in
endeavouring to restore oliver les the should die before he could be
hanged in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a
sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant

giles whispered the voice from the stair head

im here miss replied mr giles dont be frightened miss i
a int much injured he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss i
was soon too many for him

hush replied the young lady you frighten my aunt as much as the
thieves did is the poor creature much hurt

wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable
complacency

he looks as if he was a going miss bawled brittle sin the same
manner as before wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in
case he should

hush pray theresa goodman rejoined the lady wait quietly only
one instant while is peak to aunt

with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped
away she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person was
to be carried carefully upstairs to mr gi less room and that
brittle s was to saddle the pony and be take himself instantly to
chertsey from which place he was to despatch with all speed a
constable and doctor

but wont you take one look at him first miss asked mr giles
with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he
had skilfully brought down not one little peep miss

not now for the world replied the young lady poor fellow oh
treat him kindly giles for my sake

the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a
glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child then
bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and
solicitude of a woman




chapter xxix
has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which
oliver resorted


in a handsome room though its furniture had rather the air of
oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance there sat two ladies at
a well spread breakfast table mr giles dressed with scrupulous care
in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them he had taken his
station some halfway between the sideboard and the breakfast table
and with his body drawn up to its full height his head thrown back
and inclined theme rest trifle on one side his left leg advanced and
his righthand thrust into his waistcoat while his left hung down by
his side grasping a waiter looked like one who laboured under a very
agreeable sense of his own merits and importance

of the two ladies one was well advanced in years but the high backed
oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she dressed
with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of bygone
costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which
rather served to point the oldstyle pleasantly than to impair its
effects he satin a stately manner with her hands folded on the
table before her here yes and age had dimmed but little of their
brightness were attentively upon her young companion

the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood
at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned
in mortal forms they maybe without impiety supposed to abide in
such as hers

she was not past seventeen cast in so slight and exquisite a mould so
mild and gentle so pure and beautiful that earth seemed not her
element nor its rough creatures her fit companions the very
intelligence that shone in her deepblue eye and was stamped upon her
noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world and yet the
changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights
that played about the face and left no shadow there above all the
smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside
peace and happiness

she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table chancing to
raise here yes as the elder lady was regarding her she playfully put
back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead and threw into
her beaming look such an expression of affection and artless
loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to lookup on her

and brittle s has been gone upwards of an hour has he asked the old
lady after a pause

an hour and twelve minutes ma am replied mr giles referring to a
silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon

he is always slow remarked the old lady

brittle s always was as lowboy ma am replied the attendant and
seeing by the bye that brittle shad been as lowboy for upwards of
thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a
fast one

he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady

it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other
boys said the young lady smiling

mr giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the garden gate out
of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door
and who getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process
burst into the room and nearly overturned mr giles and the
breakfast table together

in ever heard of such a thing exclaimed the fat gentleman my dear
mrs may lie bless my soul in the silence of the night too in ever
heard of such a thing

with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands
with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found
themselves

you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright said the fat
gentleman why didnt you send bless me my man should have come in a
minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or
anybody im sure under such circumstances dear dear so unexpected
in the silence of the night too

the doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
been unexpected and attempted in the nighttime as if it were the
established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
business at noon and to make an appointment by post a day or two
previous

and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i

oh very much so indeed said rose interrupting him but there is
a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see

ah to be sure replied the doctor so there is that was your
handiwork giles i understand

mr giles who had been feverishly putting the teacups to rights
blushed very red and said that he had had that honour

honour eh said the doctor well i dont know perhaps its as
honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at
twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a duel
giles

mr giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was
not for the like of him to judge about that but he rather thought it
was no joke to the opposite party

gad thats true said the doctor where is he show me the way
ill look in again as i come down mrs may lie thats the little
window that he got in a teh well i couldnt have believed it

talking all the way he followed mr giles upstairs and while he is
going upstairs the reader maybe informed that mr los berne a
surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit often miles
round as the doctor had grown fat more from good humour than from
good living and was as kind and hearty and with alas eccentric an old
bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any explorer
alive

the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had
anticipated a large flat box was fetched out of the gig and a bedroom
bell was rung very often and the servants ran up and downstairs
perpetually from which tokens it was justly concluded that something
important was going on above at length he returned and in reply to an
anxious inquiry after his patient looked very mysterious and closed
the door carefully

this is a very extraordinary thing mrs may lie said the doctor
standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut

he is not in danger i hope said the old lady

why that would not bean extraordinary thing under the
circumstances replied the doctor though i dont think he is have
you seen the thief

no rejoined the old lady

nor heard anything about him

no

i beg your pardon ma am interposed mr giles but i was going to
tell you about him when doctor los berne came in

the fact was that mr giles had not at first be enable to bring his
mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy such commendations had
been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of him
help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes during
which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief reputation for
undaunted courage

rose wished to see the man said mrs may lie but i wouldnt hear of
it

humph rejoined the doctor there is nothing very alarming in his
appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence

if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not

then i think it is necessary said the doctor at all events i am
quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you
postponed i the is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me miss
rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my
honour




chapter xxx
relates what olivers new visitors thought of him


with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised
in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm
through one of his and offering his disengaged hand to mrs may lie
led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs

now said the doctor in a whisper a she softly turned the handle of
a bedroom door let us hear what you think of him he has not been
shaved very recently but he dont look at all ferocious
notwithstanding stop though let me first see that he is in visiting
order

stepping before them he looked into the room motioning them to
advance he closed the door when they had entered and gently drew back
the curtains of the bed upon it in lieu of the dogged black visage d
ruffian they had expected to behold the relay a mere child worn with
pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep his wounded arm bound
and splintered up was crossed upon his breast his head reclined upon
the other arm which was half hidden by his longhair as it streamed
over the pillow

the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a
minute or so in silence whilst he was watching the patient thus the
younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the
bedside gathered olivers hair from his face as she stooped over him
her tears fell upon his forehead

the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity
and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
he had never known thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of
water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or the mention of a
familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
that never were in this life which vanish like a breath which some
brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have
awakened which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall

what can this mean exclaimed the elder lady this poor child can
never have been the pupil of robbers

vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in
many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine
her

but at so early an age urged rose

my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his
head crime like death is not confined to the old and withered
alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims

but can you oh can you really believe that this delicate boy has
been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society said
rose

the surgeons hook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared
it was very possible and observing that they might disturb the
patient led the way into an adjoining apartment

but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is
think that he may never have known a mothers love or the comfort of a
home that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven
him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt aunt dear aunt for
mercy s sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child
to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of
amendment o has you love me and know that i have never felt the want
of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done
so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor
child have pity upon him before it is too late

my dearlove said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to
her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head

ohno replied rose eagerly

no surely said the old lady my days are drawing to their close
and may mercy be shown to me as is how it to others what can i do to
save him sir

let me think ma am said the doctor let me think

mr los berne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns
up and down the room often stopping and balancing himself on his
toes and frowning frightfully after various exclamation so five got
it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking and
frowning heat length made a dead halt and spoke as follows

i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles
and that little boy brittle si can manage it giles is a faithful
fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a
thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you
dont object to that

unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied mrs
may lie

there is no other said the doctor no other take my word for it

then my aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through
her tears but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is
indispensably necessary

you seem to think retorted the doctor that everybody is disposed
to be hard hearted today except yourself miss rose i only hope for
the sake of the rising male sex generally that you maybe found in as
vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow
who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that
i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for
doing so as the present

you areas great a boy as poor brittle s himself returned rose
blushing

well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult
matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is
yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i daresay and although i
have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that hemus nt
be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse
with him without danger now i make this stipulation that i shall
examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we
judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he
is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall
be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at
all events

ohno aunt entreated rose

oh yes aunt said the doctor is is a bargain

he can not be hardened in vice said rose it is impossible

very good retorted the doctor then so much the more reason for
acceding to my proposition

finally the treaty was entered into and the parties thereunto sat down
to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake

the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial
than mr los berne had led them to expect for hour after hour passed
on and still oliver slumbered heavily it was evening indeed before
the kindhearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he was at
length sufficiently restored to be spoken to the boy was very ill he
said and weak from the loss of blood but his mind was so troubled
with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give
him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next
morning which he should otherwise have done

the conference was along one oliver told them all his simple history
and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength it was a
solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice of the
sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which
hard men had brought upon him oh if when we oppress and grind our
fellow creatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of
human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly it
is true but not less surely to heaven top our their after vengeance
on our heads if we heard but one instant in imagination the deep
testimony of dead mens voices which no power can stifle and no pride
shutout where would be the injury and injustice the suffering
misery cruelty and wrong that each days life brings with it

olivers pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night and loveliness
and virtue watched him ashes lep the felt calm and happy and could
have died without a murmur

the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to
rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them
for being weak all at once be took himself downstairs to open upon mr
giles and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that
he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the
kitchen so into the kitchen he went

there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament
the women servants mr brittle smr giles the tinker who had
received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of
the day in consideration of his services and the constable the
latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and
large half boots and he looked as if he had been taking a
proportionate allowance of ale as indeed he had

the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion for
mr giles was expat i ating upon his presence of mind when the doctor
entered mr brittle s with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating
everything before his superior said it

sit still said the doctor waving his hand

thankyou sir said mr giles misses wished some ale to be given
out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir
and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here

brittle s headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen
generally were understood to express the gratification they derived
from mr gi less condescension mr giles looked round with a
patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved
properly he would never desert them

how is the patient tonight sir asked giles

so so returned the doctor i am afraid you have got yourself into a
scrape there mr giles

i hope you dont mean to say sir said mr giles trembling that
hes going to die if i thought it i should never be happy again i
wouldnt cut a boy off no not even brittle s here not for all the
plate in the county sir

thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously mr giles are
you a protestant

yessir i hopes of altered mr giles who had turned very pale

and what are you boy said the doctor turning sharply upon
brittle s

lord bless me sir replied brittle s starting violently im the
same as mr giles sir

then tell me this said the doctor both of you both of you are
you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is
the boy that was put through the little window last night out with it
come we are prepared for you

the doctor who was universally considered one of the best tempered
creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger
that giles and brittle s who were considerably muddled by ale and
excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction

pay attention to the reply constable will you said the doctor
shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the
bridge of his nose with it to be speak the exercise of that worthy s
utmost acuteness something may come of this before long

the constable looked as wise a she could and took up his staff of
office which had been reclining indolent lyin the chimney corner

its a simple question of identity you will observe said the
doctor

thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great
violence for he had finished hi sale in a hurry and some of it had
gone the wrong way

heres the housebroken into said the doctor and a couple of men
catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke
and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness here sa boy comes to
that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his
arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him by doing which they
place his life in great danger and swear he is the thief now the
question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in
what situation do they place themselves

the constable nodded profoundly he said if that wasnt law he would
be glad to know what was

i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn
oaths able to identify that boy

brittle s looked doubtfully at mr giles mr giles looked doubtfully at
brittle s the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the
reply the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen the
doctor glanced keenly round when a ring was heard at the gate and at
the same moment the sound of wheels

its the runners cried brittle s to all appearance much relieved

the what exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn

the bowstreet officers sir replied brittle staking up a candle
me and mr giles sent for em this morning

what cried the doctor

yes replied brittle si sent a message up by the coachman and i
only wonder they were n there before sir

you did did you then confound your slow coaches down here thats
all said the doctor walking away




chapter xxx i
involves a critical position


whos that inquired brittle s opening the door a little way with
the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand

open the door replied a man outside its the officers from bow
street as was sent to today

much comforted by this assurance brittle s opened the door to its full
width and confronted a port lyman in a greatcoat who walked in
without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on them at as coolly
as if he lived there

just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you youngman said
the officer he sin the giga minding the prad have you got a coach
us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes

brittle s replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building
the port lyman stepped back to the garden gate and helped his
companion to put up the gig while brittle slighted them in a state of
great admiration this done they returned to the house and being
shown into a parlour took off their great coats and hats and showed
like what they were

the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle
height aged about fifty with shiny black hair cropped pretty close
half whiskers around face and sharp eyes the other was a
redheaded bony man in top boots with a rather ill favoured
countenance and a turned up sinister looking nose

tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you said the
stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on
the table oh good evening master can i have a word or two with you
in private if you please

this was addressed to mr los berne who now made his appearance that
gentleman motioning brittle store tire brought in the two ladies and
shut the door

this is the lady of the house said mr los berne motioning towards
mrs may lie

mr blathers made a bow being desired to sitdown he put his hat on
the floor and taking a chair motioned to duff to do the same the
latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good
society or quite so much a this ease in it one of the two seated
himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and
the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment

now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers what
are the circumstances

mr los berne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at
great length and with much circumlocution messrs blathers and duff
looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod

icant say for certain till i see the work of course said
blathers but my opinion at once is i dont mind committing myself to
that extent that this wasnt done by a yokel eh duff

certainly not replied duff

and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i
apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a
countryman said mr los berne with a smile

that sit master replied blathers this is all about the robbery
is it

all replied the doctor

now what is this about this here boy that the servants area talking
on said blathers

nothing at all replied the doctor one of the frightened servants
chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house but its nonsense sheer absurdity

wery easy disposed of if it is remarked duff

what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in
a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if
they were a pair of castanets who is the boy what account does he
give of himself where did he come from he didnt dropout of the
clouds did he master

of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two
ladies i know his whole history but we can talkabout that
presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves
made their attempt i suppose

certainly rejoined mr blathers we had better inspect the premises
first and examine the servants afterwards thats the usual way of
doing business

lights were then procured and messrs blathers and duff attended by
the native constable brittle s giles and everybody else in short
went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at
the window and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in
at the window and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the
shutter with and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with
and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with this done amidst
the breathless interest of all be holders they came in again and mr
giles and brittle s were put through a melodramatic representation of
their share in the previous nights adventures which they performed
some six times over contradicting each other in not more than one
important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the
last this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared the
room and held along council together compared with which for
secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knott i est
point in medicine would be mere childsplay

meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
state and mrs may lie and rose looked on with anxious faces

upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very
rapid turns i hardly know what to do

surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to
these men will be sufficient to exonerate him

i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head i
dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal
functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say
a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his
story is a very doubtful one

you believe it surely interrupted rose

i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i maybe an old fool for
doing so rejoined the doctor but i dont think it is exactly the
tale for a practical police officer nevertheless

why not demanded rose

because my pretty cross examiner replied the doctor because
viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about i the can
only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well
confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and
will take nothing for granted on his own showing you see he has been
the companion of thieves for sometime pas the has been carried to a
police officer on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket he has
been taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place
which he can not describe or point out and of the situation of which he
has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who
seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and
is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very
moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so doth everything
that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a
blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose
to prevent his doing any good for himself dont you see all this

i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors
impetuosity but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the
poor child

no replied the doctor of course not bless the bright eyes of your
sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any
question and that is always the one which first presents itself to
them

having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his
hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even
greater rapidity than before

the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will
occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
possession of the boys real story i am certain it will not be
believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the
dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will
be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan
of rescuing him from misery

oh what is to be done cried rose dear dear why did they send
for these people

why indeed exclaimed mrs may lie i would not have had them here
for the world

all i know is said mr los berne at last sitting down with a kind
of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold
face the object is a good one and that must be our excuse the boy
has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be
talked to anymore thats one comfort we must make the best of it
and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours come in

well master said blathers entering the room followed by his
colleague and making the door fast before he said anymore this
war nt a put up thing

and what the devils a put up thing demanded the doctor
impatiently

we call it a put up robbery ladies said blathers turning to them
as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors
when the servants is in it

nobody suspected them in this case said mrs may lie

wery likely not ma am replied blathers but they might have been
in it for all that

more likely on that wery account said duff

we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report
for the style of work is first rate

wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an undertone

there was two of em in it continued blathers and they had a boy
with em thats plain from the size of the window thats all to be
said at present well see this lad that youve got upstairs at once
if you please

perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs may lie said
the doctor his face brightening as if some new thought had occurred
to him

oh to be sure exclaimed rose eagerly you shall have it
immediately if you will

why thankyou miss said blathers drawing his coat sleeve across
his mouth its dry work this sort of duty any think that shandy
miss dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts

what shall it be asked the doctor following the young lady to the
sideboard

a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied
blathers its a cold ride from london ma am and i always find that
spirits comes home warmer to the feelings

this interesting communication was addressed to mrs may lie who
received it very graciously while it was being conveyed to her the
doctor slipped out of the room

ah said mr blathers not holding his wineglass by the stem but
grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his lefthand
and placing it in front of his chest i have seen a good many pieces
of business like this in my time ladies

that crackdown in the back lane at edmonton blathers said mr
duff assisting his colleagues memory

that was something in this way warn titre joined mr blathers
that was done by conkey chickweed that was

you always gave that to him replied duff it was the family pet i
tell you conkey hadnt anymore to do with it than i had

get out retorted mr blathers i know better do you mind that time
when conkey was robbed of his money though what a start that was
better than any novel book i ever see

what was that inquired rose anxious to encourage any symptoms of
good humour in the unwelcome visitors

it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down
upon said blathers this here conkey chickweed

conkey means nosey ma am interposed duff

of course the lady knows that dont she demanded mr blathers
always interrupting you are partner this here conkey chickweed
miss kept a public house over battle bridgeway and he had a cellar
where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and
badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
conducted in for ive seen em offen he warn tone of the family at
that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and
twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom
in the dead of night by at allman with a black patch over his eye
who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the
robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high he was
wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he fired a
blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they setup a
hue and cry directly and when they came to look about em found that
conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way
to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em however
he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr
chickweed licensed wit ler appeared in the gazette among the other
bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont
know what all was got up for the poorman who was in a wery low state
of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or
four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many
people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day
he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview
with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and
orders jem spy ers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go
and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house
i see him spy ers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morning
why didnt you up and collar him says spy ers i was so struck all
of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick
says the poorman but were sure to have him for between ten and
eleven oclock at night he passed again spy ers no sooner heard this
than he put some clean linen and a combin his pocket in case he
should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself
down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain
with his hat on allready to bolt out at a moments notice he was
smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed
roars out here he is stop thief murder jem spy ers dashes out and
there he sees chickweed a tearing down the street full cry away goes
spy erson goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out
thieves and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like
mad spy ers loses sight of him a minute a she turns a corner shoots
round sees a little crowd dives in which is them and me says
chickweed ive lost him again it was a remarkable occurrence but
he war nt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public house
next morning spy ers took his old place and looked out from behind
the curtain for at allman with a black patch over his eye till his
own two eyes ached again atlas the couldnt help shutting em to
ea seem a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed
a roaring out here he is off he starts once more with chickweed
halfway down the street ahead of him and after twice as long arunas
the yesterdays one the mans lost again this was done once or twice
more till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been
robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arter wards and
the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief

what did jem spy ers say inquired the doctor who had returned to the
room shortly after the commencement of the story

jem spy ers resumed the officer for along time said nothing at
all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he
understood his business but one morning he walked into the bar and
taking out his snuff box says chickweed ive found out who done this
here robbery have you said chickweed oh my dear spy ers only
let me have wenge ance and i shall die contented oh my dear spy ers
where is the villa income said spy ers offering him a pinch of
snuff none of that gammon you did it yourself so he had and a
good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have
found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up
appearances said mr blathers putting down his wineglass and
clinking the handcuffs together

very curious indeed observed the doctor now if you please you
can walk upstairs

if you please sir returned mr blathers closely following mr
los berne the two officers ascended to olivers bedroom mr giles
preceding the party with alighted candle

oliver had been dozing but looked worse and was more feverish than he
had appeared yet being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up in
bed for a minute or so and looked at the strangers without at all
understanding what was going forward in fact without seeming to
recollect where he was or what had been passing

this said mr los berne speaking softly but with great vehemence
notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a
spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what dye call him s
grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this
morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his
life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify

messrs blathers and duff looked at mr giles a she was thus
recommended to their notice the bewildered butler gazed from them
towards oliver and from oliver towards mr los berne with a most
ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity

you dont mean to deny that i suppose said the doctor laying
oliver gently down again

it was all done for the for the best sir answered giles i am sure
i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him i am not
of an in human disposition sir

thought it was what boy inquired the senior officer

the house breakers boy sir replied giles they they certainly had
a boy

well do you think so now inquired blathers

think what now replied giles looking vacantly a this questioner

think its the same boy stupid head rejoined blathers impatiently

i dont know i really dont know said giles with a rueful
countenance i couldnt swear to him

what do you think asked mr blathers

i dont know what to think replied poor giles i dont think it is
the boy indeed im almost certain that it isnt you know it cant
be

has this man been a drinking sir inquired blathers turning to the
doctor

what a precious muddle headed chap you are said duff addressing mr
giles with supreme contempt

mr los berne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short
dialogue but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked
that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would
perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittle s before them

acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring
apartment where mr brittle s being called in involved himself and
his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light on
anything but the fact of his own strong mystification except indeed
his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put
before him that instant that he had only taken oliver to be he
because mr giles had said he was and that mr giles had five minutes
previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much
afraid he had been a little too hasty

among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether
mr giles had really hit anybody and upon examination of the fellow
pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more
destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper a discovery which
made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor who had
drawn the ball about ten minutes before upon no one however did it
make a greater impression than on mr giles himself who after
labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a
fellow creature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to
the utmost finally the officers without troubling themselves very
much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took
up their rest for that night in the town promising to return the next
morning

with the next morning there came a rumour that t women and a boy were
in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended overnight under
suspicious circumstances and to kingston messrs blathers and duff
journeyed accordingly the suspicious circumstances however resolving
themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been
discovered sleeping under a haystack which although a great crime is
only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the
english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects
held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence
that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with
violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
punishment of death messrs blathers and duff came back again as wise
as they went

in short after some more examination and a great deal more
conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the
joint bail of mrs may lie and mr los berne for olivers appearance if
he should ever be called upon and blathers and duff being rewarded
with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the
subject of their expedition the latter gentleman on amature
consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that
the burglar ious attempt had originated with the family pet and the
former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
great mrc on key chickweed

meanwhile oliver gradually th rove and prospered under the united care
of mrs may lie rose and the kindhearted mr los berne if fervent
prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in
heaven and if they be not what prayers are the blessings which the
orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing
peace and happiness




chapter xxxii
of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends


oliver sailings were neither slight nor few in addition to the pain
and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold
had broughton fever and ague which hung about him for many weeks and
reduced him sadly but at length he began by slow degrees to get
better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words how
deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how ardently
he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do something
to show his gratitude only something which would let them see the
love and duty with which his breast was full something however
slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not
been castaway but that the poorboy whom their charity had rescued
from misery or death was eager to serve them with his whole heart and
soul

poor fellow said rose when oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale
lips you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will we
are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall
accompany us the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasure and
beauties of spring will restore you in a few days we will employ you
in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble

the trouble cried oliver oh dear lady if i could but work for
you if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or
watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make
you happy what would i give to do it

you shall give nothing at all said miss may lie smiling for as i
told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways and if you only
take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make
me very happy indeed

happy ma am cried oliver how kind of you to say so

you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady
to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
anyone from such sad misery as you have described to us would bean
unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness
and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence
would delight me more than you can well imagine do you understand
me she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face

oh yes ma am yes replied oliver eagerly but i was thinking that
i am ungrateful now

to whom inquired the young lady

to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care
of me before rejoined oliver if they knew how happy i am they
would be please diam sure

i am sure they would rejoined olivers benef actress and mr
los berne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well
enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them

hashem a am cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure i
dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once
again

in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the
fatigue of this expedition one morning he and mr los bernese tout
accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to mrs may lie when
they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a
loud exclamation

whats the matter with the boy cried the doctor as usual all in a
bustle do you see anything hear anything feel anything eh

that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window that
house

yes well what of its top coachman pullup here cried the doctor
what of the house my man eh

the thieves the house they took me to whispered oliver

the devil it is cried the doctor hallo there let me out

but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled
out of the coach by some means or other and running down to the
deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman

hallo a said a little ugly humpback edman opening the door so
suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick
nearly fell forward into the passage whats the matter here

matter exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments
reflection a good deal robbery is the matter

there ll be murder the matter too replied the humpback edman
coolly if you dont take your hands off do you hear me

i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake

where s confound the fellow whats his rascally name sikes thats
it where s sikes you thief

the humpback edman stared as if in excess of amazement and
indignation then twisting himself dexterously from the doctors
grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the
house before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed
into the parlour without a word of parley

he looked anxiously round not an article of furniture not a vestige
of anything animate or inanimate not even the position of the
cupboards answered olivers description

now said the humpback edman who had watched him keenly what do
you mean by coming into my house in this violent way do you want to
rob me or to murder me which is it

did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair
you ridiculous old vampire said the irritable doctor

what do you want then demanded the hunchback will you take
yourself off before i do you a mischief curse you

as soon as i think proper said mr los berne looking into the other
parlour which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to
olivers account of it i shall find you out someday my friend

will you sneered the ill favoured cripple if you ever want me im
here i havent lived here mad and all alone for five and twenty
years to be scared by you you shall pay for this you shall pay for
this and so saying the misshapen little demon setup a yell and
danced upon the ground as if wild with rage

stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself the boy must
have made a mistake here put that in your pocket and shut yourself
up again with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money
and returned to the carriage

the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations
and curses all the way but as mr los berne turned to speak to the
driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant
with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and
vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months
afterwards he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until
the driver had resumed his seat and when they were once more on their
way they could see him some distance behind beating his feet upon the
ground and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage

i a man ass said the doctor after along silence did you know
that before oliver

no sir

then dont forget it another time

an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some
minutes even if it had been the right place and the right fellows
had been there what could i have done singlehanded and if i had had
assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my
own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i
have hushed up this business that would have served me right though
i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on
impulse it might have done me good

now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon
anything but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment
to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from
being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortune she had the
warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him if the truth must be
told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being
disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on
the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any he
soon came round again however and finding that olivers replies to
his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still
delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever
been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that
time forth

as oliver knew the name of the street in which mrbrown low resided
they were enabled to drive straight thither when the coach turned into
i this heartbeat so violently that he could scarcely draw his
breath

now my boy which house is it inquired mr los berne

that that replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window the
whitehouse oh make haste pray make haste i feel as if i should
die it makes me tremble so

come come said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder you
will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and
well

oh i hope so cried oliver they were so good to me so very very
good to me

the coach rolled on it stopped no that was the wrong house the next
door it went on a few paces and stopped again oliver looked up at
the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face

alas the whitehouse was empty and there was a bill in the window
to let

knock at the nextdoor cried mr los berne taking olivers armin
his what has become of mrbrown low who used to live in the
adjoining house do you know

the servant did not know but would go and inquire she presently
returned and said that mrbrown low had sold off his goods and gone
to the west indies six weeks before oliver clasped his hands and
sank feebly backward

has his housekeeper gone too inquired mr los berne after a moments
pause

yessir replied the servant the old gentleman the housekeeper
and a gentleman who was a friend of mrbrown lows all went together

then turn towards home again said mr los berne to the driver and
dont stop to bait the horse still you get out of this confounded
london

the bookstall keeper sir said oliveri know the way there see
him pray sir do see him

my poorboy this is disappointment enough for one day said the
doctor quite enough for both of us if we goto the bookstall
keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house
on fire or runaway no home again straight and in obedience to the
doctors impulse home they went

this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in
the midst of his happiness for he had pleased himself many times
during his illness with thinking of all that mrbrown low and mrs
bed win would say to him and what delight it would be to tell them how
many long days and night she had passed in reflecting on what they had
done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them the hope
of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he
had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many
of his recent trials and now the idea that they should have gone so
far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a
robber a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day was
almost more than he could bear

the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of
his benefactors after another fortnight when the fine warm weather
had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young
leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house
at chertsey for some months

sending the plate which had so excited fagin s cupidity to the
bankers and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took
oliver with them

who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft
tranquillity the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green
hills and richwoods of an inland village who can tell how scenes of
peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain worn dwellers in close
and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded
hearts men who have lived in crowded pent up streets through lives
of to il and who have never wished for change men to whom custom has
indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick
and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks even
they with the hand of death upon them have been known to year nat
last for one short glimpse of natures face and carried far from the
scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to passat once
into a new state of being crawling forth from day today to some
green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by
the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a
foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they
have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they
watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before faded
from their dim and feeble sight the memories which peaceful country
scenes call up are not of this world nor of its thoughts and hopes
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the
graves of those we loved may purify our thoughts and bear down before
it old enmity and hatred but beneath all this there lingers in the
least reflective mind a vague and half formed consciousness of having
held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time which
calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down pride
and worldliness beneath it

it was a lovely spot to which they repaired oliver whose days had
been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and
brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there the rose and
honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls the ivy crept round the trunks
of the trees and the garden flowers perfumed the air with delicious
odours hard by was a little churchyard not crowded with tall
unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh
turf and moss beneath which the old people of the village lay at
rest oliver often wandered here and thinking of the wretched grave
in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen
but when he raised his eyes to the deepsky overhead he would cease
to think of her as lying in the ground and would weep for her sadly
but without pain

it was a happy time the days were peaceful and serene the nights
brought with them neither fear nor care no languishing in a wretched
prison or associating with wretched men nothing but pleasant and
happy thoughts every morning he went to a white headed old gentleman
who lived near the little church who taught him to read better and to
write and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could
never try enough to please him then he would walk with mrs may lie
and rose and hear them talk of books or perhaps sit near them in
some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read which he could
have done until it grew too dark to see the letters then he had his
own lesson for the next day to prepare and at this he would work
hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came
slowly on when the ladies would walkout again and he with them
listening with such pleasure to all they said and so happy if they
wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything
he could run to fetch that he could never be quick enough about it
when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would
sitdown to the piano and play some pleasant air or singin a low
and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear
there would be no candles lighted at such times as these and oliver
would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music in a
perfect rapture

and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from anyway
in which he had ever spent it yet and how happily too like all the
other days in that most happy time there was the little church in the
morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows the birds
singing without and the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low
porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance the poor
people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that
it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there
together and though the singing might be rude it was real and
sounded more musical to oliver sears atleast than any he had ever
heard in church before then there were the walks as usual and many
calls at the clean houses of the labouring men and at night oliver
read a chapter or two from the bible which he had been studying all
the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and
pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself

in the morning oliver would be a foot by six oclock roaming the
fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nose gays of wild
flowers with which he would return laden home and which it took
great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the
embellishment of the breakfast table there was fresh groundsel too
for miss may lies birds with which oliver who had been studying the
subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the
cages in the most approved taste when the birds were made all spruce
and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of
charity to execute in the village or failing that there was rare
cricket playing sometimes on the green or failing that there was
always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which
oliver who had studied this science also under the same master who
was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty goodwill until
miss rose made her appearance when there were a thousand commendations
to be bestowed on all he had done

so three months glided away three months which in the life of the
most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been un mingled
happiness and which in olivers were true felicity with the purest
and most amiable generosity on one side and the truest warmest
soul felt gratitude on the other it is no wonder that by the end of
that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with
the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his
young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment
to himself




chapter xxxiii
where in the happiness of oliver and his friends experiences a sudden
check


spring flew swiftly by and summer came if the village had been
beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
richness the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the
earlier months had now burst into strong life and health and
stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground converted
open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant
shade from which to lookup on the wide prospect steeped in sunshine
which lay stretched beyond the earth had donned her mantle of
brightest green and shed her richest perfumes abroad it was the prime
and vigour of the year all things were glad and flourishing

still the same quiet life went on at the little cottage and the same
cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates oliver had long since
grown stout and healthy but health or sickness made no difference in
his warm feelings of a great many people he was still the same gentle
attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and
suffering had wasted his strength and when he was dependent for every
slight attention and comfort on those who tended him

one beautiful night when they had taken a longer walk than was
customary with them for the day had been unusually warm and there was
a brilliant moon and a light wind had sprung up which was unusually
refreshing rose had been in high spirits too and they had walked on
in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their ordinary
bounds mrs may lie being fatigued they returned more slowly home the
young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnets at down to the piano
as usual after running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes
she fell into a low and very solemn air and as she played it they
heard a sound as if she were weeping

rose my dear said the elder lady

rose made no reply but played a little quicker as though the words
had roused her from some painful thoughts

rose my love cried mrs may lie rising hastily and bending over
her what is this in tears my dear child what distresses you

nothing aunt nothing replied the young lady i dont know what it
is icant describe it but i feel

not ill my love interposed mrs may lie

non ooh not ill replied rose shuddering as though some deadly
ch illness were passing over her while she spoke i shall be better
presently close the window pray

oliver hastened to comply with her request the young lady making an
effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune
but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys covering her face with
her hands she sank upon as of a and gave vent to the tears which she
was now unable to repress

my child said the elderly lady folding her arms about her in ever
saw you so before

i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose but indeed
i have tried very hard and can not help this i fear i a mill aunt

she was indeed for when candles were brought they saw that in the
very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of
her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness its expression had
lost nothing of its beauty but it was changed and there was an
anxious haggard look about the gentle face which it had never worn
before another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush and a
heavy wildness came over the soft blueeye again this disappeared
like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud and she was once more deadly
pale

oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was
alarmed by these appearances and so in truth was he but seeing that
she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and
they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to
retire for the night she was in better spirits and appeared even in
better health assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in
the morning quite well

i hope said oliver when mrs may lie returned that nothing is the
matters he dont look well tonight but

the old lady motioned to him not to speak and sitting herself down in
a dark corner of the room remained silent for sometime at length
she said in a trembling voice

i hope not oliveri have been very happy with her for some years
too happy perhaps it maybe time that i should meet with some
misfortune but i hope it is not this

what inquired oliver

the heavy blow said the old lady of losing the dear girl who has
so long been my comfort and happiness

oh god forbid exclaimed oliver hastily

a men to that my child said the old lady wringing her hands

surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful said oliver two
hours ago she was quite well

she is very ill now rejoined mrs may lies and will be worse i am
sure my dear dear rose oh what shall i do without her

she gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own
emotion ventured to remonstrate with her and to beg earnestly that
for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm

and consider ma am said oliver as the tears forced themselves into
his eyes despite of his efforts to the contrary oh consider how
young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all
about her i am sure certain quite certain that for your sake who are
so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so
happy she will not die heaven will never let her die so young

hush said mrs may lie laying her hand on olivers head you think
like a child poorboy but you teach me my duty notwithstanding i
had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i maybe pardoned
for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
agony of separation from the objects of our love i have seen enough
too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared
to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow
for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there
is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy
gods will be done i love her and he know show well

oliver was surprised to see that as mrs may lie said these words she
checked her lamentations as though by one effort and drawing herself
up as she spoke became composed and firm he was still more astonished
to find that this firmness lasted and that under all the care and
watching which ensued mrs may lie was ever ready and collected
performing all the duties which had devolved upon her steadily and
to all external appearances even cheerfully but he was young and did
not know what strong minds are capable of under trying circumstances
how should he when their possessors so seldom know themselves

an anxious night ensued when morning came mrs may lies predictions
were but too well verified rose was in the first stage of a high and
dangerous fever

we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said
mrs may lie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into
his face this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to
mr los berne it must be carried to the market town which is not more
than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence
dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the
people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to
see it done i know

oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to begone at once

here is another letter said mrs may lie pausing to reflect but
whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i
scarcely know i would not forward it unless i feared the worst

is it for chertsey to oma am inquired oliver impatient to execute
his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter

no replied the old lady giving it to him mechanically oliver
glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry may lie esquire
at some great lords house in the country where he could not make
out

shall it gomaa masked oliver looking up impatiently

i think not replied mrs may lie taking it back i will wait until
tomorrow

with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off
without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster

swiftly her an across the fields and down the little lanes which
sometimes divided them now almost hidden by the high corn on either
side and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers
were busy at their work nor did he stop once save now and then for a
few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and
covered with dust on the little marketplace of the market town

here he paused and looked about for the inn there were a white bank
and a red brewery and a yellow townhall and in one corner there was
a large house with all the wood about it painted green before which
was the sign of the george to this he hastened as soon as it caught
his eye

he spoke to a post boy who was dozing under the gateway and who after
hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler who after hearing
all he had to say again referred him to the landlord who was at all
gentleman in a blue neck cloth a white hat drab breeches and boots
with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stable door picking
his teeth with a silver toothpick

this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out
the bill which took along time making out and after it was ready
and paid a horse had to be saddled andaman to be dressed which
took up ten good minutes more meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate
state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could have
jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to the
next stage at length all was ready and the little parcel having been
handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy
delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven
paving of the marketplace was out of the town and galloping along
the turnpike road in a couple of minutes

as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and
that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the inn yard with a
somewhat lighter hear the was turning out of the gateway when he
accidently stumbled against at allman wrapped in a cloak who was at
that moment coming out of the inn door

hah cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly
recoiling what the devils this

i beg your pardon sir said oliveri was in a great hurry to get
home and didnt see you were coming

death muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large
dark eyes who would have thought it grind him to a she shed start
up from a stone coffin to come in my way

i am sorry stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild
look i hope i have not hurt you

rot you murmured the man in a horrible passion between his
clenched teeth if i had only had the courage to say the word i might
have been free of you in a night curses on your head and black death
on your heart you imp what are you doing here

the man shook his fist a she uttered these words incoherently he
advanced towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at
him but fell violently on the ground writhing and foaming in a fit

oliver gazed for a moment at the struggles of the madman for such he
supposed him to be and then darted into the house for help having
seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards
running as fast a she could to makeup for lost time and recalling
with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary
behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted

the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however for
when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and
to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory

rose may lie had rapidly grown worse before midnight she was
delirious a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in
constant attendance upon her and after first seeing the patient he
had taken mrs may lie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a
most alarming nature in fact he said it would be little short of
a miracle if she recovered

how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out
with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest
sound from the sick chamber how often did a tremble shake his frame
and cold drops of terror startup on his brow when a sudden trampling
of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had
even then occurred and what had been the fervency of all the prayers
he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the
agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the
gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge

oh the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by
while the life of one wed early love is trembling in the balance oh
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heartbeat
violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they
conjure up before it the desperate anxiety to be doing something to
relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to
alleviate the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of
our helplessness produces what tortures can equal these what
reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the time
allay them

morning came and the little cottage was lonely and still people spoke
in whispers anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time
women and children went away in tears all the live long day and for
hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the
garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and
shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay
stretched inside late that night mr los berne arrived it is hard
said the good doctor turning away a she spoke so young so much
beloved but there is very little hope

another morning the sun shone brightly as brightly as if it looked
upon no misery or care and with every leaf and flower in full bloom
about her with life and health and sounds and sights of joy
surrounding her on every side the fair young creature lay wasting
fast oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one
of the green mound swept and prayed for her in silence

there was such peace and beauty in the scene so much of brightness and
mirth in the sunny landscape such blithe some music in the songs of the
summer birds such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering
overhead so much of life and joyousness in all that when the boy
raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively
occurred to him that this was not a time for death that rose could
surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay that
graves were for cold and cheerless winter not for sunlight and
fragrance he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
shrunken and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in
their ghastly folds

a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts
another again it was tolling for the funeral service a group of
humble mourners entered the gate wearing white favours for the corpse
was young they stood uncovered by a grave and there was am other a
mother once among the weeping train but the sun shone brightly and
the birds sang on

oliver turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received
from the young lady and wishing that the time could come again that
he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was he
had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect or want of
thought for he had been devoted to her service and yet a hundred
little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have
been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been we need be
careful how we deal with those about us when every death carries to
some smallcircle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so
little done of so many things forgotten and so many more which might
have been repaired there is no remorse so deep as that which is
unavailing if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this
in time

when he reached home mrs may lie was sitting in the little parlour
olivers heart sank at sight of her for she had never left the bedside
of her niece and he trembled to think what change could have driven
her away he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which
she would wake neither to recovery and life or to bid them farewell
and die

they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours the un tasted meal
was removed with looks which showed that their thoughts were
elsewhere they watched the sun a she sank lower and lower and at
length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his
departure their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep they both involuntarily darted to the door as mr los berne
entered

what of rose cried the old lady tell meat once i can bear it
anything but suspense oh tell me in the name of heaven

you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her be calm
my dear ma am pray

let me going ods name my dear child she is dead she is dying

no cried the doctor passionately a she is good and merciful she
will live to bless us all for years to come

the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together but
the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her
first thanksgiving and she sank into the friendly arms which were
extended to receive her




chapter xxxiv
contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman
who now arrives upon the scene and a new adventure which happened to
oliver


it was almost too much happiness to bear oliver felt stunned and
stupefied by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak
or res the had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
passed until after along ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of
tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a
full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast

the night was fast closing in when he returned homeward laden with
flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of
the sick chamber a she walked briskly along the road he heard behind
him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace looking
round he saw that it was a post chaise driven at great speed and as
the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning
against agate until it should have passed him

as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap
whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that
he could not identify the person in another second or two the
nightcap was thrust out of the chaise window and a stentorian voice
bellowed to the driver to stop which he did as soon a she could pull
up his horses then the nightcap once again appeared and the same
voice called oliver by his name

here cried the voice oliver whats the news miss rose master
oliver

is it you giles cried oliver running up to the chaise door

giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply
when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news

in a word cried the gentleman better or worse

better much better replied oliver hastily

thank heaven exclaimed the gentleman you are sure

quite sir replied oliver the change took place only a few hours
ago and mr los berne says that all danger is at an end

the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaise door
leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside

you are quite certain there is no possibility of any mistake on your
part my boy is there demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice
do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled

i would not for the world sir replied oliver indeed you may
believe me mr los berne swords were that she would live to bless us
all for many years to come i heard him say so

the tears stood in olivers eyes as here called the scene which was the
beginning of so much happiness and the gentleman turned his face away
and remained silent for some minutes oliver though the heard him sob
more than once but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark for
he could well guess what his feelings were and so stood apart feigning
to be occupied with his nosegay

all this time mr giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting
on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and
wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with
white spots that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was
abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the
young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him

i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles
said he i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time
before i see her you can say i am coming

i beg your pardon mr harry said giles giving a final polish to
his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief but if you would leave
the post boy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it
wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state siri should
never have anymore authority with them if they did

well rejoined harry may lie smiling you can do as you like let
him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us
only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering
or we shall be taken for madmen

mr giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and
pocketed his nightcap and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape
which he took out of the chaise this done the post boy drove off
giles mr may lie and oliver followed at their leisure

as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much
interest and curiosity at the newcomer he seemed about
five and twenty years of age and was of the middle height his
countenance was frank and handsome and his demeanor easy and
pre possessing notwithstanding the difference between youth and age he
bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have had
no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not
already spoken of her as his mother

mrs may lie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached
the cottage the meeting did not take place without great emotion on
both sides

mother whispered the youngman why did you not write before

i did replied mrs may lie but on reflection i determined to keep
back the letter until i had heard mr los berne s opinion

but why said the youngman why run the chance of that occurring
which so nearly happened if rose had i can not utter that word now if
this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have
for given yourself how could i ever have know happiness again

if that had been the case harry said mrs may lie i fear your
happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival
here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little
import

and who can wonder if it be so mother rejoined the young manor
why should i say if it is it is you know it mother you must know
it

i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
offer said mrs may lie i know that the devotion and affection of
her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and
lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed
behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my
task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the
strict line of duty

this is unkind mother said harry do you still suppose that i am a
boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own
soul

i think my dear son returned mrs may lie laying her hand upon his
shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and
that among them are some which being gratified become only the more
fleeting above all i think said the lady fixing here yes on her
sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a
wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no
fault of hers maybe visited by cold and sordid people upon her and
upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the
world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against
him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent
of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of
knowing that he does so

mother said the youngman impatiently he would be a selfish
brute unworthy a like of the name of man and of the woman you describe
who acted thus

you think so now harry replied his mother

and ever will said the youngman the mental agony i have suffered
during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion
which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have
lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly
as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought no view no
hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you
take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind
mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the
happiness of which you seem to think so little

harry said mrs may lie it is because i think so much of warm and
sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we
have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now

let it rest with rose then interposed harry you will not press
these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle
in my way

i will not rejoined mrs may lie but i would have you consider

i have considered was the impatient reply mother i have
considered years and years i have considered ever since i have been
capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they
ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them
vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave
this place rose shall hear me

she shall said mrs may lie

there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she
will hear me coldly mother said the youngman

not coldly rejoined the old lady far from it

how then urged the youngman she has formed no other attachment

no indeed replied his mother you have or i mistake too strong a
hold on her affections already what i would say resumed the old
lady stopping her son a she was about to speak is this before you
stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried
to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child
on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her
doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with
all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of
self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her
characteristic

what do you mean

that i leave you to discover replied mrs may lie i must go back to
her god bless you

i shall see you again tonight said the youngman eagerly

by and by replied the lady when i leave rose

you will tell her i am here said harry

of course replied mrs may lie

and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how
i long to see her you will not refuse to do this mother

no said the old lady i will tell her all and pressing her sons
hand affectionately she hastened from the room

mr los berne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment
while this hurried conversation was proceeding the former now held out
his hand to harry may lie and hearty salutations were exchanged between
them the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious questions
from his young friend a precise account of his patients situation
which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as olivers
statement had encouraged him to hope and to the whole of which mr
giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened with greedy
ears

have you shot anything particular lately giles inquired the
doctor when he had concluded

nothing particular sir replied mr giles colouring up to the eyes

nor catching any thieves nor identifying any house breakers said
the doctor

none at all sir replied mr giles with much gravity

well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that
sort of thing admirably pray how is brittle s

the boy is very well sir said mr giles recovering his usual tone
of patronage and sends his respectful duty sir

that swell said the doctor seeing you here reminds me mr
giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so
hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small
commission in your favour just step into this corner a moment will
you

mr giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder
and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on
the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with
steps of unusual stateliness the subject matter of this conference was
not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily enlightened
concerning it for mr giles walked straight thither and having called
for a mug of ale announced with an air of majesty which was highly
effective that it had pleased his mistress in consideration of his
gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery to
deposit in the local savings bank the sum of five and twenty pounds
for his sole use and benefit at this the two women servants lifted up
their hands and eyes and supposed that mr giles pulling out his
shirt frill replied no no and that if they observed that he was
at all haughty to his inferior she would thank them to tell him so
and then he made a great many other remarks no less illustrative of
his humility which were received with equal favour and applause and
were with alas original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of
great men commonly are

above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away for
the doctor was in high spirits and however fatigued or thoughtful
harry may lie might have been at first he was not proof against the
worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great
variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of
small jokes which struck oliver as being the droll est things he had
ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately to the evident
satisfaction of the doctor who laughed im moderately at himself and
made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy so
they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they could
well have been and it was late before they retired with light and
thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and
suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need

oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual
occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many
days the birds were once more hung out to singin their old places
and the sweetest wildflowers that could be found were once more
gathered to gladden rose with their beauty the melancholy which had
seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over
every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic the dew
seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the air to rustle
among them with a sweeter music and the sky itself to look more blue
and bright such is the influence which the condition of our own
thoughts exercise even over the appearance of external objects men
who look on nature and their fellowmen and cry that all is dark and
gloomy are in the right but the sombre colours are reflections from
their own jaundiced eyes and hearts the real hues are delicate and
need a clearer vision

it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time
that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone harry may lie
after the very first morning when hemet oliver coming laden home was
seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in
their arrangement as left his young companion far behind if oliver
were behind hand in these respect she knew where the best were to be
found and morning after morning they scoured the country together and
brought home the fairest that blossomed the window of the young ladys
chamber was opened now for she loved to feel the rich summer air
stream in and revive her with its freshness but there always stood in
water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch which was
made up with great care every morning oliver could not help noticing
that the withered flowers were never thrown away although the little
vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that
whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably cast his eyes
up to that particular corner and nodded his head most expressively as
he set forth on his mornings walk pending these observations the
days were flying by and rose was rapidly recovering

nor did olivers time hang heavy on his hands although the young lady
had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now
and then for a short distance with mrs may lie he applied himself
with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the white headed old
gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even
himself it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was
greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence

the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy a this
books was on the groundfloor at the back of the house it was quite
a cottage room with a lattice window around which were clusters of
jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the
place with their delicious perfume it looked into a garden whence a
wicket gate opened into a small paddock all beyond was fine
meadowland and wood there was no other dwelling near in that
direction and the prospect it commanded was very extensive

one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning
to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his
books he had been poring over them for sometime and as the day had
been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is
no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say
that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep

there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it
holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things
about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasures of ar as an
overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called
sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us and if we dream at such a time words which are
really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate
themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and
imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
matter of impossibility to separate the two nor is this the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state it is an undoubted
fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead
yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before
us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent
presence of some external object which may not have been near us when
we closed our eyes and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
consciousness

oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room that
his books we relying on the table before him that the sweet air was
stirring among the creeping plants outside and ye the was asleep
suddenly the scene changed the air became close and confined and he
thought with aglow of terror that he was in the jews house again
there sat the hideous oldman in his accustomed corner pointing at
him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat
beside him

hush my dear he though the heard the jew say it is he sure
enough come away

he the other man seemed to answer could i mistake him think you
if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and
he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to
point him out if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across
his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that
he lay buried there

the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver
awoke with the fear and started up

good heaven what was that which sent the blood tingling to his heart
and deprived him of his voice and of power to move there there at the
window close before him so close that he could have almost touched him
before he started back with his eyes peering into the room and
meeting his there stood the jew and beside him white with rage or
fear or both were the scowling features of the man who had accosted
him in the inn yard

it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes and they
were gone but they had recognised him and he them and their look was
as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply carved in
stone and set before him from his birth he stood transfixed for a
moment then leaping from the window into the garden called loudly
for help




chapter xxxv
containing the unsatisfactory result of olivers adventure and a
conversation of some importance between harry may lie and rose


when the inmates of the house attracted by olivers cries hurried to
the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated
pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house and scarcely
able to articulate the words the jew the jew

mr giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant but harry
may lie whose perceptions were something quicker and who had heard
olivers history from his mother understood it at once

what direction did he take he asked catching up a heavy stick which
was standing in a corner

that replied oliver pointing out the course the man had taken i
missed them in an instant

then they are in the ditch said harry follow and keep as near
me as you can so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off
with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
others to keep near him

giles followed as well a she could and oliver followed too and in the
course of a minute or two mr los berne who had been out walking and
just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking
himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to
possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting
all the while most prodigiously to know what was the matter

on they all went nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader
striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver began to
search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining which afforded time
for the remainder of the party to come up and for oliver to
communicate to mr los berne the circumstances that had led to so
vigorous a pursuit

the search was all in vain there were not even the traces of recent
footsteps to be seen they stood now on the summit of a little hill
commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles
there was the village in the hollow on the left but in order to gain
that after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out the men must
have made a circuit of open ground which it was impossible they could
have accomplished in so short a time a thick wood skirted the
meadowland in another direction but they could not have gained that
covert for the same reason

it must have been a dream oliver said harry may lie

ohno indeed sir replied oliver shuddering at the very
recollection of the old wretch s countenance i saw him too plainly
for that i saw them both as plainly as i see you now

who was the other inquired harry and mr los berne together

the very same man it old you of who came so suddenly upon meat the
inn said oliver we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i
could swear to him

they took this way demanded harry are you sure

asia m that the men were at the window replied oliver pointing
down a she spoke to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from
the meadow the tallman leaped over just there and the jew running
a few paces to the right crept through that gap

the two gentlemen watched olivers earnest face a she spoke and
looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he said still in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight the grass was
long but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own feet had
crushed it the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay but
in no one place could they discern the print of mens shoes or the
slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
ground for hours before

this is strange said harry

strange echoed the doctor blathers and duff themselves could
make nothing of it

notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did
not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further
prosecution hopeless and even then they gave it up with reluctance
giles was dispatched to the different ale houses in the village
furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance
and dress of the strangers of these the jew was at all events
sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen
drinking or loitering about but giles returned without any
intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery

on the next day fresh search was made and the inquiries renewed but
with no better success on the day following oliver and mr may lie
repaired to the market town in the hope of seeing or hearing something
of the men there but this effort was equally fruitless after a few
days the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when
wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself

meanwhile rose was rapidly recovering she had left her room was able
to go out and mixing once more with the family carried joy into the
hearts of all

but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
circle and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more
heard in the cottage there was at times an unwonted restraint upon
some there even upon rose herself which oliver could not fail to
remark mrs may lie and her son were often closeted together for along
time and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon her
face after mr los berne had fixed a day for his departure to chertsey
these symptoms increased and it became evident that something was in
progress which affected the peace of the young lady and of somebody
else besides

at length one morning when rose was alone in the breakfast parlour
harry may lie entered and with some hesitation begged permission to
speak with her for a few moments

a few a very few will suffice rose said the youngman drawing his
chair towards her what i shall have to say has already presented
itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not
unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated

rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance but that might
have been the effect of her recent illness she merely bowed and
bending over some plants that stood near waited in silence for him to
proceed

ii ought to have left here before said harry

you should indeed replied rose forgive me for saying so but i
wish you had

i was brought hereby the most dreadful and agonising of all
apprehensions said the youngman the fear of losing the one dear
being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed you had been dying
trembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the
beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits
insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know
heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade
in blooming

there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl as these words were
spoken and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent and
glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as
though the outpouring of her fresh young heart claimed kindred
naturally with the loveliest things in nature

a creature continued the youngman passionately a creature as
fair and innocent of guile as one of gods own angels fluttered
between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to
which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to
the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were
passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts
upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all
these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved
you these were distractions almost too great to bear they were mine
by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears
and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never
know how devotedly i loved you as almost bored own sense and reason in
its course you recovered day by day and almost hour by hour some
drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a
high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to
life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has
softened my heart to all mankind

i did not mean that said rose weeping i only wish you had left
here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to
pursuits well worthy of you

there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest
nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours
said the youngman taking her hand rose my own dear rose for
years for years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and
then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to
share thinking in my daydream show i would remind you in that happy
moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boys attachment
and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that
had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with
not fame won and no young vision realised ioffer you the heart so
long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the
offer

your behaviour has ever been kind and noble said rose mastering the
emotions by which she was agitated as you believe that i am not
insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer

it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose

it is replied rose that you must endeavour to forget me not as
your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply
but as the object of your love look into the world think how many
hearts you would be proud to gain are there confide some other
passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most
faithful friend you have

there was a pause during which rose who had covered her face with
one hand gave free vent to her tears harry still retained the other

and your reasons rose he said at length in a low voice your
reasons for this decision

you have a right to know them rejoined rose you can say nothing to
alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it a like
to others and to myself

to yourself

yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portion less
girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason
to suspect that i had sordid ly yielded to your first passion and
fastened myself ac logon all your hopes and projects i owe it to
you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your
generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world

if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty harry began

they do not replied rose colouring deeply

then you return my love said harry say but that dear rose say
but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment

if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved
rejoined rose i could have

have received this declaration very differently said harry do not
conceal that from meat least rose

i could said rose stay she added disengaging her hand why
should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet
productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be
happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which
i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me
with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry as we have met
today we meet no more but in other relations than those in which
this conversation have placed us we maybe long and happily entwined
and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can
call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper
you

another word rose said harry your reason in your own words from
your own lips let me hear it

the prospect before you answered rose firmly is a brilliant one
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can
help men in public life are in store for you but those connections
are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the
mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of
her who has so well supplied that mothers place in a word said the
young lady turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there
is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i
will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest
alone on me

one word more rose dearest rose one more cried harry throwing
himself before her if i had been less less fortunate the world would
call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if i had
been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then or has my
probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth

do not press me to reply answered rose the question does not
arise and never will it is unfair almost unkind to urge it

if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted harry
it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the
path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance
of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else oh rose
in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i
have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this
one question

then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined rose if you
had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been
a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement
and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i
should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy
very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier

busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a girl long ago crowded
into the mind of rose while making this avowal but they brought tears
with them as old hopes will when they comeback withered and they
relieved her

i can not help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said
rose extending her hand i must leave you now indeed

i ask one promise said harry once and only once more say within
a year but it maybe much sooner i may speak to you again on this
subject for the last time

not to press me to alter my right determination replied rose with a
melancholy smile it will be useless

no said harry to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat
it i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may
possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not
seek by word or act to change it

then let it be so rejoined rose it is but one pang the more and
by that time i maybe enabled to bear it better

she extended her hand again but the youngman caught her to his bosom
and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead hurried from the
room




chapter xxxvi
is a very short one and may appear of no great importance in its
place but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last
and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives


and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning
eh said the doctor as harry may lie joined him and oliver at the
breakfast table why you are not in the same mind or intention two
half hours together

you will tell me a different tale one of these days said harry
colouring without any perceptible reason

i hope i may have good cause to do so replied mr los berne though
i confess i dont think i shall but yesterday morning you had made up
your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your
mother like a dutiful son to the seaside before noon you announce
that you are going to dome the honour of accompanying me as far as i
go on your road to london and at night you urge me with great
mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of
which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when
he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all
kinds too bad isnt it oliver

i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and
mr may lie went away sir rejoined oliver

that sa fine fellow said the doctor you shall come and see me
when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication
from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be
gone

the great nobs replied harry under which designation i presume
you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with meat
all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it
likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate
attendance among them

well said the doctor you area queer fellow but of course they
will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and
these sudden shifting sand changes are no bad preparation for political
life theres something in that good training is always desirable
whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes

harry may lie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue
by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a
little but he contented himself with saying we shall see and
pursued the subject no farther the post chaise drove up to the door
shortly afterwards and giles coming in for the luggage the good
doctor bustled out to see it packed

oliver said harry may lie in a low voice let me speak a word with
you

oliver walked into the window recess to which mr may lie beckoned him
much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits which
his whole behaviour displayed

you can write well now said harry laying his hand upon his arm

i hope so sir replied oliver

i shall not beat home again perhaps for sometime i wish you would
write to me say once a fortnight every alternate monday to the
general post office in london will you

oh certainly siri shall be proud to do it exclaimed oliver
greatly delighted with the commission

i should like to know how how my mother and miss may lie are said the
youngman and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
take and what you talkabout and whether she they i mean seem happy
and quite well you understand me

oh quite sir quite replied oliver

i would rather you did not mention it to them said harry hurrying
over his words because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her let it be a secret
between you and me and mind you tell me everything i depend upon
you

oliver quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance
faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications
mr may lie took leave of him with many assurances of his regard and
protection

the doctor was in the chaise giles who it had been arranged should
be left behind held the door open in his hand and the women servants
were in the garden looking on harry cast one slight glance at the
latticed window and jumped into the carriage

drive on he cried hard fast full gallop nothing short of flying
will keep pace with me today

hallo a cried the doctor letting down the front glass in a great
hurry and shouting to the post illion something very short of flying
will keep pace with me do you hear

jingling and clattering till distance rendered its noise inaudible
and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye the vehicle wound
its way along the road almost hidden in a cloud of dust now wholly
disappearing and now becoming visible again as intervening objects
or the intricacies of the way permitted it was not until even the
dusty cloud was no longer to be seen that the gazers dispersed

and there was one looker on who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot
where the carriage had disappeared long after it was many miles away
for behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when
harry raised his eyes towards the windows at rose herself

he seems in high spirits and happy she said at length i feared
for a time he might be otherwise i was mistaken i am very very
glad

tears are signs of gladness as well as grief but those which course d
down roses face as she sat pensively at the window still gazing in
the same direction seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy




chapter xxxvii
in which the reader may perceive a contrast not uncommon in
matrimonial cases


mr bumble satin the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on
the cheerless grate whence as it was summertime no brighter gleam
proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which
were sent back from its cold and shining surface a paper fly cage
dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in
gloomy thought and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy
network mr bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy
shadow overspread his countenance mr bumble was meditating it might
be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own
past life

nor was mr bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator there were not wanting
other appearances and those closely connected with his own person
which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of
his affairs the laced coat and the cocked hat where were they he
still wore knee breeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether
limbs but they were not the breeches the coat was wide skirted and
in that respect like the coat but oh how different the mighty
cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one mr bumble was no longer
a beadle

there are some promotions in life which independent of the more
substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from
the coats and waistcoats connected with them a field marshal has his
uniform a bishop his silk apron a counsellor his silk gown a beadle
his cocked hats trip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his hat
and lace what are they men mere men dignity and even holiness too
sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people
imagine

mr bumble had married mrs corney and was master of the workhouse
another beadle had come into power on him the cocked hat gold laced
coat and staff had all three descended

and tomorrow two months it was done said mr bumble with a sigh
it seems a age

mr bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence
of happiness into the short space of eight weeks but the sight here
was avast deal of meaning in the sigh

is old myself said mr bumble pursuing the same train of r election
for six teaspoons a pair of sugar tongs and a milk pot with a small
quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money i went
very reasonable cheap dirt cheap

cheap cried a shrill voice in mr bumbles ear you would have been
dear at any price and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows
that

mr bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort
who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his
complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture

mrs bumble ma am said mr bumble with a sentimental sternness

well cried the lady

have the goodness to look at me said mr bumble fixing his eyes
upon her

if she stands such a eye as that said mr bumble to himself she
can stand anything it is a eye in ever knew to fail with paupers if
it fails with her my power is gone

whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition or
whether the late mrs corney was particularly proof against eagle
glances are matters of opinion the matter of fact is that the
matron was in no way overpowered by mr bumbles scowl but on the
contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh
there at which sounded as though it were genuine

on hearing this most unexpected sound mr bumble looked first
incredulous and afterwards amazed he then relapsed into his former
state nor did hero use himself until his attention was again awakened
by the voice of his partner

are you going to sit snoring there all day inquired mrs bumble

i am going to si there as long as i think proper ma am rejoined
mr bumble and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape
sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my
prerogative

your prerogative sneered mrs bumble with ineffable contempt

i said the word ma am said mr bumble the prerogative of a man is
to command

and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness cried
the relict of mr corney deceased

too beyma am thundered mr bumble your late unfortunate husband
should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive
now i wish he was poorman

mrs bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now
arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or
other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this
allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with
aloud scream that mr bumble was a hard hearted brute fell into a
paroxysm of tears

but tears were not the things to find their way to mr bumbles soul
his heart was waterproof like washable beaver hats that improve with
rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of
tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of
his own power pleased and exalted him he eyed his good lady with
looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that
she should cry her hardest the exercise being looked upon by the
faculty as strongly conducive to health

it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and
softens down the temper said mr bumble so cry away

a she discharged himself of this pleasantry mr bumble took his hat
from a peg and putting it on rather rakish lyon ones ideas a man
might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner
thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with
much ease and waggish ness depicted in his whole appearance

now mrs corney that was had tried the tears because they were less
troublesome than a manual assault but she was quite prepared to make
trial of the latter mode of proceeding as mr bumble was not long in
discovering

the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow
sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
opposite end of the room this preliminary proceeding laying bare his
head the expert lady clasping him tightly round the throat with one
hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and
dexterity upon it with the other this done she created a little
variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair and having by
this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the
offences he pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated
for the purpose and defied him to talkabout his prerogative again if
he dared

get up said mrs bumble in a voice of command and take yourself
away from here unless you want metodo something desperate

mr bumble rose with a very rueful countenance wondering much what
something desperate might be picking up his ha the looked towards the
door

are you going demanded mrs bumble

certainly my dear certainly rejoined mr bumble making a quicker
motion towards the door i didnt intend to im going my dear you
are so very violent that really i

at this instant mrs bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle mr bumble immediately
darted out of the room without bestowing another thought on his
unfinished sentence leaving the late mrs corney in full possession of
the field

mr bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten he had a
decided propensity for bullying derived no in considerable pleasure
from the exercise of petty cruelty and consequently was it is
needless to say a coward this is by no means a disparagement to his
character for many official personages who are held in high respect
and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities the remark is
made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of
impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for
office

but the measure of his degradation was not yet full after making a
tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poor laws
really were too hard on people and that men who ran away from their
wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought injustice to be
visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious
individuals who had suffered much mr bumble came to a room where some
of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish
linen when the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded

hem said mr bumble summoning up all his native dignity these
women atleast shall continue to respect the prerogative hallo hallo
there what do you mean by this noise you hussies

with these words mr bumble opened the door and walked in with a very
fierce and angry manner which was at once exchanged for a most
humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the
form of his lady wife

my dear said mr bumble i didnt know you were here

didnt know i was here repeated mrs bumble what do you do
here

i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
properly my dear replied mr bumble glancing distractedly at a
couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of
admiration at the workhouse masters humility

you thought they were talking too much said mrs bumble what
business is it of yours

why my dear urged mr bumble submissively

what business is it of yours demanded mrs bumble again

its very true you re matron here my dear submitted mr bumble
but i thought you might nt be in the way just then

ill tell you what mr bumble returned his lady we dont want any
of your interference your ea great deal to of on d of poking your nose
into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house
laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a
fool every hour in the day be off come

mr bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two
old paupers who were titte ring together most rapturously hesitated
for an instant mrs bumble whose patience brooke d no delay caught up
a bowl of soapsuds and motioning him towards the door ordered him
instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly
person

what could mr bumble do he looked dejectedly round and slunk away
and a she reached the door the titte rings of the paupers broke into a
shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight it wanted but this he was
degraded in their eyes he had lost caste and station before the very
pauper she had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadle ship to
the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen pecker y

all in two months said mr bumble filled with dismal thoughts two
months no more than two months ago i was not only my own master but
everybody elses so far as the p orochi al workhouse was concerned and
now

it was too much mr bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie and
walked distractedly into the street

he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated
the first passion of his grief and then the revulsion of feeling made
him thirsty he passed a great many public houses but at length
paused before one in a by way whose parlour a she gathered from a
has type ep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary
customer it began to rain heavily at the moment this determined
him mr bumble stepped in and ordering something to drink a she
passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the
street

the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large
cloak he had the air of a stranger and seemed by a certain
haggard ness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to
have travelled some distance he eyed bumble askance a she entered
but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his
salutation

mr bumble had quite dignity enough for two supposing even that the
stranger had been more familiar so he drank his g in and water in
silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance

it so happened however as it will happen very often when men fall
into company under such circumstances that mr bumble felt every now
and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a
look at the stranger and that whenever he did so he withdrew his
eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment
stealing a look at him mr bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the
very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and
bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike
anything he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold

when they had encountered each others glance several times in this
way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence

were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window

not that i am aware of unless your emr here mr bumble stopped
short for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in
his impatience he might supply the blank

i see you were not said the stranger an expression of quiet sarcasm
playing about his mouth or you have known my name you dont know it
i would recommend you not to ask for it

i meant no harm youngman observed mr bumble majestically

and have done none said the stranger

another silence succeeded this short dialogue which was again broken
by the stranger

i have seen you before i think said he you were differently
dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should
know you again you were beadle here once were you not

i was said mr bumble in some surprise p orochi al beadle

just so rejoined the other nodding his head it was in that
character i saw you what are you now

master of the workhouse rejoined mr bumble slowly and
impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might
otherwise assume master of the workhouse youngman

you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i
doubt not resumed the stranger looking keenly into mr bumbles
eyes a she raised them in astonishment at the question

dont scruple to answer freely man i know you pretty well you see

i suppose a married man replied mr bumble shading his eyes with
his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident
perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can
than a single one p orochi al officers are not so well paid that they
can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a
civil and proper manner

the stranger smiled and nodded his head again as much to say he had
not mistaken his man then rang the bell

fill this glass again he said handing mr bumbles empty tumbler to
the landlord let it be strong and hot you like it so i suppose

not too strong replied mr bumble with a delicate cough

you understand what that means landlord said the stranger drily

the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a
steaming jo rum of which the first gulp brought the water into mr
bumbles eyes

now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and
window i came down to this place today to find you out and by
one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends
sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you
were uppermost in my mind i want some information from you i dont
ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is put up that to begin
with

a she spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
companion carefully as though unwilling that the chin king of money
should be heard without when mr bumble had scrupulously examined the
coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much
satisfaction in his waistcoat pocket he went on

carry your memory back let me see twelve years last winter

its along time said mr bumble very good ive done it

the scene the workhouse

good

and the time night

yes

and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable
drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to
themselves gave birth top u ling children for the parish to rear and
hid their shame rotem in the grave

the lying in room i suppose said mr bumble not quite following
the strangers excited description

yes said the stranger a boy was born there

a many boys observed mr bumble shaking his head despond ingly

amur rain on the young devils cried the stranger is peak of one a
meek looking pale faced boy who was apprenticed down here to a
coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in
it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed

why you mean oliver young twist said mr bumble i remember him
of course there wasnt a obstinate r young rascal

its not of him i want to hear ive heard enough of him said the
stranger stopping mr bumble in the outset of at i radeon the subject
of poor olivers vices its of a woman the hag that nursed his
mother where is she

where is she said mr bumble whom the g in and water had rendered
facetious it would be hard to tell theres no midwifery there
whichever place shes gone to so i suppose shes out of employment
anyway

what do you mean demanded the stranger sternly

that she died last winter rejoined mr bumble

the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and
although he did not withdraw his eyes for sometime afterwards his
gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in
thought for sometime he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be
relieved or disappointed by the intelligence but at length he breathed
more freely and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great
matter with that he rose as if to depart

but mr bumble was cunning enough and heat once saw that an
opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in
the possession of his better half he well remembered the night of old
sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good
reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to mrs
corney and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure
of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know
that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans
attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist
hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger
with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old
harri dan shortly before she died and that she could a she had reason
to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry

how can i find her said the stranger thrown off his guard and
plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused
a fresh by the intelligence

only through mere joined mr bumble

when cried the stranger hastily

tomorrow rejoined bumble

at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of
paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the waterside
in characters that betrayed his agitation at nine in the evening
bring her to me there i need nt tell you to be secret its your
interest

with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for
the liquor that had been drunk shortly remarking that their roads were
different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic
repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night

on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it
contained no name the stranger had not gone far so he made after him
to ask it

what do you want cried the man turning quickly round as bumble
touched him on the arm following me

only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of
paper what name am i to ask for

monks rejoined the man and strode hastily away




chapter xxxviii
containing an account of what passed between mr and mrs bumble and
mr monks at their nocturnal interview


it was a dull close overcast summer evening the clouds which had
been threatening all day spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of
vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a
violent thunderstorm when mr and mrs bumble turning out of the
mainstreet of the town directed their course towards a scattered
little colony of ruinous houses distant from it some mile and a half
or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon
the river

they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might
perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
rain and sheltering them from observation the husband carried a
lantern from which however no light yet shone and trudged on a few
paces in front as though the way being dirty to give his wife the
benefit of treading in his heavy footprints they went on in profound
silence every now and the nmr bumble relaxed hi space and turned
his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following then
discovering that she was close a this heels he mended his rate of
walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards
their place of destination

this was far from being a place of doubtful character for it had long
been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under
various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on
plunder and crime it was a collection of mere hovels some hastily
built with loose bricks others of old worm eaten ship timber jumbled
together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for
the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank a few leaky boats
drawn upon the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirt edit
and here and there an oar or coil of rope appeared at first to
indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some
avocation on the river but a glance at the shattered and useless
condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passerby
without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were disposed
there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view
to their being actually employed

in the heart of this cluster of huts and skirting the river which its
upper stories overhung stood a large building formerly used as a
manufactory of some kind it had in its day probably furnished
employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements but it had
long since gone to ruin the rat the worm and the action of the damp
had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood and a considerable
portion of the building had already sunk down into the water while the
remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream seemed to wait a
favourable opportunity of following it sold companion and involving
itself in the same fate

it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as
the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain
commenced pouring violently down

the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap
of paper he held in his hand

hallo a there cried a voice from above

following the sound mr bumble raised his head and descried a man
looking out of a door breast high on the second story

standstill a minute cried the voice ill be with you directly
with which the head disappeared and the door closed

is that the man asked mr bumbles good lady

mr bumble nodded in the affirmative

then mind what it old you said the matron and be careful to say
as little as you can or youll betray us at once

mr bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was
apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was
prevented by the appearance of monks who opened a small door near
which they stood and beckoned them inwards

come in he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground
dont keep me here

the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any
other invitation mr bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind
followed obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that
remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic

what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet said
monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the
door behind them

we we were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking
apprehensively about him

cooling yourselves retorted monks not all the rain that ever fell
or ever will fall will putas much of hells fire out as a man can
carry about with him you wont cool yourself so easily dont think
it

with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and
ben this gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was
fain to withdraw here yes and turn them towards the ground

this is the woman is it demanded monks

hem that is the woman replied mr bumble mindful of his wifes
caution

you think women never can keep secrets i suppose said the matron
interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks

i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks

and what may that be asked the matron

the loss of their own good name replied monks so by the same
rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her im not afraid of her telling it to anybody not i do you
understand mistress

no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke

of course you dont said monks how should you

bestowing something halfway between a smile and a frown upon his two
companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened
across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the
roof he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder
leading to another floor of warehouses above when a bright flash of
lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed
which shook the crazy building to its centre

hear i the cried shrinking back hear it rolling and crashing on
as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding
from it i hate the sound

he remained silent for a few moments and then removing his hands
suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable dis composure of mr
bumble that it was much distorted and discoloured

these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his
alarm and thunder sometimes brings the mon dont mind me now its
all over for this once

thus speaking he led the way up the ladder and hastily closing the
window shutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which
hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy
beams in the ceiling and which cast a dim light upon an old table and
three chairs that we replaced beneath it

now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the
sooner we come to our business the better for all the woman know what
it is does she

the question was addressed to bumble but his wife anticipated the
reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it

he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died
and that she told you something

about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron
interrupting him yes

the first question is of what nature washer communication said
monks

thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation the
first is what may the communication be worth

who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is
asked monks

nobody better than you i am persuaded answered mrs bumble who did
not want for spirit as her yoke fellow could abundantly testify

humph said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry
there maybe moneys worth to get eh

perhaps there may was the composed reply

something that was taken from her said monks something that she
wore something that

you had better bid interrupted mrs bumble i have heard enough
already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to

mr bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any
greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened
to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes which he
directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised
astonishment increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded
what sum was required for the disclosure

whats it worth to you asked the woman as collected ly as before

it maybe nothing it maybe twenty pounds replied monks speak
out and let me know which

add five pounds to the sum you have named give me five and twenty
pounds in gold said the woman and ill tell you all i know not
before

five and twenty pounds exclaimed monks drawing back

i spoke as plainly as i could replied mrs bumble its not a large
sum either

not a large sum for a paltry secret that maybe nothing when its
told cried monks impatiently and which has been lying dead for
twelve years pastor more

such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value
in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute
indifference she had assumed as to lying dead there are those who
will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for
anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last

what if i pay it for nothing asked monks hesitating

you can easily take it away again replied the matron i am but a
woman alone here and unprotected

not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted mr bumble
in a voice tremulous with fear i am here my dear and besides
said mr bumble his teeth chattering a she spoke mr monks is too
much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on p orochi al persons mr
monks is aware that i am not a youngman my dear and also that i am a
little run to seed as i may say bu he has he erdi say i have no
doubt mr monks has he erd my dear that i am a very determined
officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused i only want a
little rousing thats all

as mr bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern
with fierce determination and plainly showed by the alarmed
expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and
not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration unless
indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for
the purpose

you area fool said mrs bumble in reply and had better hold your
tongue

he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a
lower tone said monks grimly so hes your husband eh

he my husband titte red the matron parrying the question

i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the
angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke so much
the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i
find that theres only one will between the mim in earnest see
here

he thrust his hand into aside pocket and producing a canvas bag told
out twenty five sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the
woman

now he said gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder
which i feel is coming up to break over the house top is gone lets
hear your story

the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break
almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from
the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say the
faces of the three nearly touched as the t women leant over the small
table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to
render her whisper audible the sickly rays of the suspended lantern
falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of
their countenances which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness
looked ghastly in the extreme

when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began
she and i were alone

was there no one by asked monks in the same hollow whisper no
sick wretch or idiot in some other bed no one who could hear and
might by possibility understand

not a soul replied the woman we were alone i stood alone beside
the body when death came over it

good said monks regarding her attentively go on

she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a
child into the world some years before not merely in the same room
but in the same bed in which she then lay dying

ay said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder
blood how things come about

the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron
nodding carelessly towards her husband the mother this nurse had
robbed

in life asked monks

in death replied the woman with something like a shudder she
stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the
dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the
infants sake

she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness did she sell it
where when to whom how long before

as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said
the matrons he fell back and died

without saying more cried monks in a voice which from its very
suppression seemed only the more furious its a lie ill not be
played with she said more ill tear the life out of you both but
ill know what it was

she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance
unmoved as mr bumble was very far from being by the strange mans
violence but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which
was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the
hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper

which contained interposed monks stretching forward

nothing replied the woman it was a pawnbrokers duplicate

for what demanded monks

in good time ill tell you said the woman i judge that she had
kept the trinket for sometime in the hope of turning it to better
account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together
money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its
running out so that if anything came of it it could still be
redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the
scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in
two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so
redeemed the pledge

where is it now asked monks quickly

there replied the woman and as if glad to be relieved of it she
hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for
a french watch which monks pouncing upon to reopen with trembling
hands it contained a little gold locket in which were two locks of
hair and a plain gold wedding ring

it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman

there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date
which is within a year before the child was born i found out that

and this is all said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the
contents of the little packet

all replied the woman

mr bumble drew along breath as if he were glad to find that the
story was over and no mention made of taking the five and twenty
pounds back again and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration
which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of
the previous dialogue

i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his
wife addressing monks after a short silence and i want to know
nothing for its safer not but i may ask you two questions may i

you may ask said monks with some show of surprise but whether i
answer or not is another question

which makes three observed mr bumble es saying a stroke of
facetious ness

is that what you expected to get from me demanded the matron

it is replied monks the other question

what do you propose to do with it can it be used against me

never rejoined monks nor against me either see here but dont
move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush

with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an
iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened
close at mr bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several
paces backward with great precipitation

look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf dont
fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were
seated over it if that had been my game

thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink and even mr bumble
himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same the turbid
water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below and all
other sounds were lost in the noise of it splashing and eddying against
the green and slimy piles there had once been a watermill beneath
the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments
of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new
impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailing ly attempted
to stem its headlong course

if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow
morning said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well

twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied
bumble recoiling at the thought

monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly
thrust it and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed apart of
some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream it
fell straight and true a sadie clove the water with a scarcely
audible splash and was gone

the three looking into each others faces seemed to breathe more
freely

there said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back
into its former position if these a ever gives up its dead as books
say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash
among it we have nothing more to say and may breakup our pleasant
party

by all means observed mr bumble with great alacrity

youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you said monks with a
threatening look i am not afraid of your wife

you may depend upon me youngman answered mr bumble bowing
himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness on
everybodys account youngman on my own you know mr monks

i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks light your
lantern and getaway from here as fast as you can

it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or mr
bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would
infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below he lighted his
lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now
carried in his hand and making no effort to prolong the discourse
descended in silence followed by his wife monks brought up the rear
after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other
sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the
rushing of the water

they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution for monks
started at every shadow and mr bumble holding his lantern a foot
above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a
marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure looking
nervously about him for hidden trap doors the gate at which they had
entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks merely exchanging a
nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into
the wet and darkness outside

they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an
invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been
hidden somewhere below bidding him go first and bear the light he
returned to the chamber he had just quitted




chapter xxxix
introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already
acquainted and show show monks and the jew laid their worthy heads
together


on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned
in the last chapter disposed of their little matter of business as
there in narrated mr william sikes awakening from an ap drowsily
growled for than inquiry what time of night it was

the room in which mr sikes propounded this question was not one of
those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it
was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great
distance from his former lodgings it was not in appearance so
desirable a habitation as his old quarters being a mean and
badly furnished apartment of very limited size lighted only by one
small window in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty
lane nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans
having gone down in the world of late for a great scarcity of
furniture and total absence of comfort together with the
disappearance of all such small moveable sas spare clothes and linen
bespoke a state of extreme poverty while the meagre and attenuated
condition of mr sikes himself would have fully confirmed these
symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration

the house breaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat
by way of dressing gown and displaying a set of features in no degree
improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled
nightcap and a stiff blackbeard of a weeks growth the dogs at at
the bedside now eyeing his master with a wistful look and now
pricking his ears and uttering a low grow las some noise in the
street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention
seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which
formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female so pale
and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been
considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has
already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to
mr sikes s question

not long gone seven said the girl how do you feel tonight bill

as weak as water replied mr sikes with anim pre cation on his eyes
and limbs here lend usa hand and let me get off this thundering
bed anyhow

illness had not improved mr sikes stem per for as the girl raised
him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her
awkwardness and struck her

whining are you said sikes come dont stand snivelling there if
you cant do anything better than that cutoff altogether dye hear
me

i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a
laugh what fancy have you got in your head now

oh youve thought better of it have you growled sikes marking the
tear which trembled in her eye all the better for you you have

why you dont mean to say you d be hard upon me tonight bill
said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder

no cried mr sikes why not

such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans
tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even
to her voice such a number of nights as ive been patient with you
nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child and this the
first that ive seen you like yourself you wouldnt have served me as
you did just now if you d thought of that would you come come say
you wouldnt

well then rejoined mr sikes i wouldnt why damme now the
girls s whining again

its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair dont
you seem to mind me itll soon be over

what ll be over demanded mr sikes in a savage voice what foolery
are you up to now again get up and bustle about and dont come over
me with your womans nonsense

at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was
delivered would have had the desired effect but the girl being really
weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and
fainted before mr sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his
threats not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon
emergency for miss nancy s hysterics were usually of that violent kind
which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance
mr sikes tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment
wholly ineffectual called for assistance

whats the matter here my dear said fagin looking in

lend a hand to the girl cant you replied sikes impatiently dont
stand chattering and grinning at me

with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls
assistance while mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who
had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on
the floor a bundle with which he was laden and snatching a bottle from
the grasp of master charles bates who came close a this heels uncorked
it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents
down the patients throat previously taking a taste himself to
prevent mistakes

give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said mr
dawkins and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the
petti cuts

these united restoratives administered with great energy especially
that department consigned to masterbates who appeared to consider his
share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry were not
long in producing the desired effect the girl gradually recovered her
senses and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon
the pillow leaving mr sikes to confront the newcomers in some
astonishment at their unlooked for appearance

why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked fagin

no evil wind at all my dear for evil winds blow nobody any good and
ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see
dodger my dear open the bundle and give bill the little trifles that
we spent all our money on this morning

in compliance with mr fagin s request the artful untied this bundle
which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth and handed
the articles it contained one by one to charley bates who placed
the mon the table with various encomium son their rarity and
excellence

sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing
to view a huge pasty sitch delicate cree tur s with sitch tender
limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no
occasion to pickem half a pound of seven and six penny green so
precious strong that if you mix it with biling water itll go night o
blow the lid of the teapot off a pound and a half of moist sugar that
the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it up to sitch a
pitch of goodness ohno two half quarter n brans pound of best fresh
piece of double gloster and to windup all some of the richest sort
you ever lush ed

uttering this last panegyric masterbates produced from one of his
extensive pockets a full sized wine bottle carefully corked while
mr dawkins at the same instant poured out a wineglass ful of raw
spirits from the bottle he carried which the invalid tossed down his
throat without a moments hesitation

ah said fagin rubbing his hands with great satisfaction youll
do bill youll do now

do exclaimed mr sikes i might have been done for twenty times
over afore you d have done anything to help me what do you mean by
leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you false hearted
waga bond

only hear him boys said fagin shrugging his shoulders and us
come to bring him all these beautiful things

the things is well enough in their way observed mr sikes a little
soothed a she glanced over the table but what have you got to say for
yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health
blunt and everything else and take no more notice of me all this
mortal time than if i was that ere dog drive him down charley

in ever see such a jolly dog as that cried masterbates doing a she
was desired smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market hed
make his for tun on the stage that dog would andrew ive the dray ma
besides

hold your d in cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed still
growling angrily what have you got to say for yourself you withered
old fence eh

i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied
the jew

and what about the other fortnight demanded sikes what about the
other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his
hole

i couldnt help it bill icant go into along explanation before
company but i couldnt help it upon my honour

upon your what growled sikes with excessive disgust here cut me
off a piece of that pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out
of my mouth or itll choke me dead

dont be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively i have
never forgot you bill never once

no ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin
youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that i have laid
shivering and burning here and bill was to do this and bill was to do
that and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon a she got well
and was quite poor enough for your work if it hadnt been for the
girl i might have died

there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word
if it hadnt been for the girl who but poor ould fagin was the means
of your having such a handy girl about you

he says true enough there said nancy coming hastily forward let
him be let him be

nancy s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the boys
receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with
liquor of which however she took very sparingly while fagin
assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought mr sikes into a
better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant
banter and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough
jokes which after repeated applications to the spirit bottle he
condescended to make

its all very well said mr sikes but i must have some blunt from
you tonight

i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew

then youve got lots at home retorted sikes and i must have some
from there

lots cried fagin holding up is hands i havent so much as would

i dont know how much youve got and i daresay you hardly know
yourself as it would take a pretty longtime to count it said sikes
but i must have some tonight and thats flat

well well said fagin with a sig hill send the artful round
presently

you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined mr sikes the artful sa
deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get
dodged by traps and so be per went ed or anything for an excuse if you
put him up to it nancy shall goto the ken and fetch it to make all
sure and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone

after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beatdown the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence protesting with many solemn ass ever ations that that would
only leave him eighteen pence to keep house with mr sikes sullenly
remarking that if he couldnt get anymore he must accompany him home
with the dodger and masterbates put the eatables in the cupboard the
jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homeward
attended by nancy and the boys mr sikes meanwhile flinging himself
on the bed and composing himself to sleepaway the time until the
young ladys return

in due course they arrived at fagin s abode where they found to by
crack it and mr chit ling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage
which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and
with i this fifteenth and last sixpence much to the amusement of his
young friends mr crack it apparently somewhat ashamed at being found
relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and
mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat
to go

has nobody been to by asked fagin

not a living leg answered mr crack it pulling up his collar its
been as dull as swipes you ought to stand something handsome fagin
to recompense me for keeping house so long damme im as flat as a
jury man and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt
had the good natur to am use this youngster horrid dull im blessed
if i ant

with these and other ejaculations of the same kind mr to by crack it
swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with
a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly
beneath the consideration of a man of his figure this done he
swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that
mr chit ling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots
till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his
acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpence san interview and that he
didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger

wot arum chap you are tom said masterbates highly amused by this
declaration

not abit of it replied mr chit lingam i fagin

a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the
shoulder and winking to his other pupils

and mr crack it is a heavy swell an the fagin asked tom

no doubt at all of that my dear

and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance anti t
fagin pursued tom

very much so indeed my dear they re only jealous tom because he
wont give it to them

ah cried tom triumphantly thats where it is he has cleaned me
out but i can go and earn some more when i like c anti fagin

to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom so makeup
your loss at once and dont lose anymore time dodger charley its
time you were on the lay come its near ten and nothing done yet

in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their
hats and left the room the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging
as they went in many witticisms at the expense of mr chit ling in
whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very
conspicuous or peculiar inasmuch as there area great number of
spirited youngbloods upon town who pay a much higher price than mr
chit ling for being seen in good society and a great number of fine
gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their
reputation upon very much the same footing as flash to by crack it

now said fagin when they had left the room ill go and get you
that cash nancy this is only the key of a little cupboard where i
keep a few odd things the boys get my dear in ever lockup my money
for ive got none to lockup my dear hahaha none to lockup its
a poor trade nancy and no thanks but im fond of seeing the young
people about me and i bear it all i bear it all hush he said
hastily concealing the key in his breast whos that listen

the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared
in no way interested in the arrival or to care whether the person
whoever he was came or went until the murmur of a mans voice reached
her ears the instant she caught the sound she to re off her bonnet and
shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under the table
the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint
of the heat in at one of languor that contrasted very remarkably
with the extreme haste and violence of this action which however had
been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at the time

bah he whispered as though nettled by the interruption its the
man i expected before hes coming downstairs not a word about the
money while hes here nance he wont stop long not ten minutes my
dear

laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to
the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without he reached
it at the same moment as the visitor who coming hastily into the
room was close upon the girl before he observed her

it was monks

only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew
back on beholding a stranger dont move nancy

the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of
careless levity withdrew here yes but a she turned towards fagin she
stole another look so keen and searching and full of purpose that if
there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly
have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person

any news inquired fagin

great

and and good asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex the
other man by being too sanguine

not bad anyway replied monks with a smile i have been prompt
enough this time let me have a word with you

the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room
although she could see that monks was pointing to her the jew perhaps
fearing she might say something aloud about the money if he
endeavoured to get rid of her pointed upward and took monks out of
the room

not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say
as they went upstairs fagin laughed and making some reply which did
not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his
companion to the second story

before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the
house the girl had slipped off her shoes and drawing her gown loosely
over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door
listening with breathless interest the moment the noise ceased she
glided from the room ascended the stairs with incredible softness and
silence and was lost in the gloom above

the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more the girl
glided back with the same unearthly tread and immediately afterwards
the t women were heard descending monks went at once into the street
and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money when he returned the
girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to begone

why nance exclaimed the jew starting back a she put down the
candle how pale you are

pale echoed the girl shading here yes with her hands as if to look
steadily at him

quite horrible what have you been doing to yourself

nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont
know how long and all replied the girl carelessly come let me get
back that sa dear

with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her
hand they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a
goodnight

when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep
and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue
her way suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite
opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened
her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run after
completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath and as if
suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do
something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears

it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full
hopelessness of her condition but she turned back and hurrying with
nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction partly to recover
lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own
thoughts soon reached the dwelling where she had left the
house breaker

if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to mr sikes
he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the
money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of
satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the
slumbers which her arrival had interrupted

it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so
much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking and with al
had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his
temper that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical
upon her behaviour and deportment that she had all the abstracted and
nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous
step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would
have been obvious to the lynx eyed fagin who would most probably have
taken the alarm at once but mr sikes lacking the niceties of
discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than
those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
towards everybody and being furthermore in an unusually amiable
condition as has been already observed saw nothing unusual in her
demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had
her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been
very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions

as that day closed in the girls excitement increased and when night
came on and she sat by watching until the house breaker should drink
himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire
in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment

mr sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water
with his g into render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass
towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when
these symptoms first struck him

why burn my body said the man raising himself on his hands a she
stared the girl in the face you look like a corpse come to life
again whats the matter

matter replied the girl nothing what do you look at me so hard
for

what foolery is this demanded sikes grasping her by the armand
shaking her roughly what is it what do you mean what are you
thinking of

of many things bill replied the girl shivering and as she did so
pressing her hands upon here yes but lord what odds in that

the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed
to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look
which had preceded them

i tell you w otitis said sikes if you havent caught the fever
and got it com in on now theres something more than usual in the
wind and something dangerous too you re not a going to no damme
you wouldnt do that

do what asked the girl

there a int said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the
words to himself there a int a staunch er hearted gal going or id
have cut her throat three months ago shes got the fever coming on
that sit

fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the
bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic the
girl jumped up with great alacrity poured it quickly out but with
her back towards him and held the vessel to his lips while he drank
off the contents

now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own
face or ill alter it so that you wont know i tag in when you do want
it

the girl obeyed sikes locking her hand in his fell backup on the
pillow turning his eyes upon her face they closed opened again
closed once more again opened he shifted his position restlessly
and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as
often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about
him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of
rising into a deep and heavy sleep the grasp of his hand relaxed the
upraised arm fell languidly by his side and he lay like one in a
profound trance

the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose
from the bedside i maybe too late even now

she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl looking fearfully
round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she
expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikes s heavy hand upon
her shoulder then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the
robbers lips and then opening and closing the room door with
noiseless touch hurried from the house

a watchman was crying half past nine down a dark passage through which
she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare

has it long gone the half hour asked the girl

itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man raising his
lantern to her face

and i can not get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy
brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street

many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards
the westend of london the clocks truck ten increasing her
impatience she to re along the narrow pavement elbowing the passengers
from side to side and darting almost under the horses heads crossed
crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their
opportunity to do the like

the woman is mad said the people turning to look after her as she
rushed away

when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were
comparatively deserted and here her headlong progress excited a still
greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past some
quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening
at such an unusual rate and a few made head upon her and looked back
surprised at her undiminished speed but they fell off one by one and
when she neared her place of destinations he was alone

it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park as
the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided her
to the spot the clocks truck eleven she had loitered for a few paces
as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance but the sound
determined her and she stepped into the hall the porters seat was
vacant she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced
towards the stairs

now young woman said a smartly dressed female looking out from a
door behind her who do you want here

a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl

a lady was the reply accompanied with a scornful look what lady

miss may lie said nancy

the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied
only by a look of virtuous disdain and summoned a man to answer her
to him nancy repeated her request

what name am i to say asked the waiter

its of no use saying any replied nancy

nor business said the man

non or that neither rejoined the girl i must see the lady

come said the man pushing her towards the door none of this take
yourself off

i shall be carried out if i go said the girl violently and i can
make that a job that two of you wont like to do isnt there anybody
here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried
for a poor wretch like me

this appeal produced an effect on a good tempered faced man cook who
with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward
to interfere

take it up for her joe cant you said this person

whats the good replied the man you dont suppose the young lady
will see such as her do you

this allusion to nancy s doubtful character raised avast quantity of
chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great
fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex and strongly
advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel

do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again
but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for
god almighty s sake

the soft hearted cook added his intercession and the result was that
the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery

whats it to be said the man with one foot on the stairs

that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss may lie alone said
nancy and that if the lady will only hear the first words he has to
says he will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned
out of doors as an impostor

i say said the man you re coming it strong

you give the message said the girl firmly and let me hear the
answer

the man ran upstairs nancy remained pale and almost breathless
listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn
of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific and of which they
became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman
was to walk upstairs

its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid

brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the
second

the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of
and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful with which
the dianas concluded

regardless of all this for she had weightier matters at heart nancy
followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber
lighted by a lamp from the ceiling here he left her and retired




chapter xl
a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber


the girls life had been squandered in the streets and among the most
noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the
womans original nature left in her still and when she heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered
and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
moment contains he felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame
and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with
whom she had sought this interview

but struggling with these better feelings was pride the vice of the
lowest and most de based creatures no less than of the high and
self assured the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the
fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scouring s of the
jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itself even
this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the
womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected
her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated so
many many traces when a very child

she raised here yes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
presented itself was that of as light and beautiful girl then bending
the mon the ground she tossed her head with affected carelessness as
she said

its a hard matter to get to see you lady if i had taken offence
and gone away as many would have done you d have been sorry for it
one day and not without reason either

i am very sorry if anyone has behaved harshly to you replied rose
do not think of that tell me why you wished to see me i am the
person you inquired for

the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the
absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl
completely by surprise and she burst into tears

oh lady lady she said clasping her hands passionately before her
face if there was more like you there would be fewer like me there
would there would

sitdown said rose earnestly if you are in poverty or affliction
i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i can i shall indeed sit
down

let me stand lady said the girl still weeping and do not speak
to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late is is that
door shut

yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance
in case she should require it why

because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of
others in your hand siam the girl that dragged little oliver back to
old fagin son the night he went out from the house in pentonville

you said rose may lie

i lady replied the girl i am the infamous creature you have heard
of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment
i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known
any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me
god do not mind shrinking openly from me lady i am younger than you
would think to look at me but i am well used to it the poorest women
fallback as i make my way along the crowded pavement

what dreadful things are these said rose involuntarily falling from
her strange companion

thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you
had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you
were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness
and and something worse than all as i have been from my cradle i may
use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be
my deathbed

i pity you said rose in a broken voice it wrings my heart to hear
you

heaven bless you for your goodness rejoined the girl if you knew
what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed but i have stolen away
from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to
tell you what i have overheard do you know a man named monks

no said rose

he knows you replied the girl and knew you were here for it was
by hearing him tell the place that i found you out

in ever heard the name said rose

then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i
more than thought before sometime ago and soon after oliver was put
into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this
man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark
i found out from what i heard that monks the man i asked you about
you know

yes said rose i understand

that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidently with two of
our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be
the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out
why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he
should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a
thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own

for what purpose asked rose

he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of
finding out said the girl and there are not many people besides me
that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i
did and i saw him no more till last night

and what occurred then

ill tell you lady last night he came again again they went
upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray
me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were
these so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of
the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is
rotting in her coffin they laughed and talked of his success in
doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild
said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed
rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been
to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him
through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital
felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit
of him besides

what is all this said rose

the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl
then he said with oaths common enough in m years but strange to
yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life
without bringing his own neck in danger he would but a she couldnt
hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he
took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet in
short fagin he says je was you are you never laid such snares as
ill contrive for my young brother oliver

his brother exclaimed rose

those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had
scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes
haunted her perpetually and more when he spoke of you and the other
lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against
him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said
there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds
of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who
your two legged spaniel was

you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this
was said in earnest

he spoke in hard and angry earnest if am a never did replied the
girl shaking her head he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i
know many who do worse things but id rather listen to them all a
dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to
reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this
i must get back quickly

but what can i do said rose to what use can i turn this
communication without you back why do you wish to return to
companions you paint in such terrible colors if you repeat this
information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the
next room you can be consigned to someplace of safety without half an
hours delay

i wish to go back said the girl i must go back because how can i
tell such things to an innocent ladylike you because among the men i
have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that
icant leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading
now

your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose
your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard
your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your
evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you
might yet be reclaimed oh said the earnest girl folding her hands
as the tears course d down her face do not turn adea fear to the
entreaties of one of your own sex the first the first i do believe
whoever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear
my words and let me save you yet for better things

lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady
you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and
if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of
sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late

it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement

it is cried the girl writhing in agony of her mind i can not leave
him now i could not be his death

why should you be asked rose

nothing could save him cried the girl if it old others what i have
told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is
the boldest and has been so cruel

is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can
resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is
madness

i dont know what it is answered the girl i only know that it is
so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and
wretched as myself i must go back whether it is gods wrath for the
wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through
every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew
that i was to die by his hand at last

what am i to do said rose i should not let you depart from me
thus

you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising
you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness
and forced no promise from you as i might have done

of what use then is the communication you have made said rose
this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me
benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve

you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl

but where can i find you again when it is necessary asked rose i
do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will
you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time

will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and
come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i
shall not be watched or followed asked the girl

i promise you solemnly answered rose

every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said
the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am
alive

stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly
towards the door think once again on your own condition and the
opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not
only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost
almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and
to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can
take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is
there no chord in your heart that i can touch is there nothing left
to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation

when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the
girl steadily giveaway your hearts love will carry you all
length seven such as you who have home friends other admirers
everything to fill them when such as i who have no certain roof but
the coffin lid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital
nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place
that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to
cure us pity us lady pity us for having only one feeling of the woman
left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort
and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering

you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which
may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet
again

not a penny replied the girl waving her hand

do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said
rose stepping gently forward i wish to serve you indeed

you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands
if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think
of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be
something not to die in the hell in which i have lived god bless you
sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought
shame on mine

thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away
while rose may lie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which
had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank
into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts




chapter xli
containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like
misfortunes seldom come alone


her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty while
she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the
confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed
had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl her words and manner
had touched rose may lies heart and mingled with her love for her
young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour was
her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope

they purposed remaining in london only three days prior to departing
for some weeks to a distant part of the coast it was now midnight of
the first day what course of action could she determine upon which
could be adopted in eight and forty hours or how could she postpone
the journey without exciting suspicion

mr los berne was with them and would be for the next two days but
rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans
impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first
explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of
olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her
representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no
experienced person these were all reasons for the greatest caution and
most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs may lie whose
first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy
doctor on the subject as to resorting to any legal adviser even if
she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of for the
same reason once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance
from harry but this awakened there collection of their last parting
and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back when the tears rose to
here yes as she pursued this train of reflection he might have by this
time learnt to forget her and to be happier away

disturbed by these different reflections inclining now to one course
and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive
consideration presented itself to her mind rose passed a sleepless and
anxious night after more communing with herself next days he arrived
at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry

if it be painful to him she thought to comeback here how painful
it will be to me but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may
come himself and studiously abstain from meeting me he did when he
went away i hardly though the would but it was better for us both
and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the very
paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep

she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and
had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without
writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the
streets with mr giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such
breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to be token some new
cause of alarm

what makes you look so flurried asked rose advancing to meet him

i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy
oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be
able to know that i have told you the truth

in ever thought you had told us anything but the truth said rose
soothing him but what is this of whom do you speak

i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to
articulate the gentleman who was so good to me mrbrown low that we
have so often talked about

where asked rose

getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight
and going into a house i didnt speak to him i couldnt speak to him
for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was notable to go up
to him but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said
he did look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here it is
heres where he lives im going there directly oh dear me dear me
what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again

with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many
other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was
craven street in the strand she very soon determined upon turning the
discovery to account

quick she said tell them to fetch a hackney coach and be ready to
go with me i will take you there directly without a minutes loss of
time i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour and
be ready as soon as you are

oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five
minutes they were on their way to craven street when they arrived
there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the
old gentleman to receive him and sending up her card by the servant
requested to see mrbrown low on very pressing business the servant
soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs and following him
into an upper room miss may lie was presented to an elderly gentleman
of benevolent appearance in a bottle green coat at no great distance
from whom was seated another old gentleman inn an keen breeches and
gaiters who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting
with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin
propped thereupon

dear me said the gentleman in the bottle green coat hastily rising
with great politeness i beg your pardon young lady i imagined it was
some importunate person who i beg you will excuse me be seated pray

mrbrown low i believe sir said rose glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken

that is my name said the old gentleman this is my friend mr
grim wig grim wig will you leave us for a few minutes

i believe interposed miss may lie that at this period of our
interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away if
i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i
wish to speak to you

mrbrown low inclined his head mr grim wig who had made on every
stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and
dropped into it again

i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally
embarrassed but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest
in hearing of him again

indeed said mrbrown low

oliver twist you knew him as replied rose

the words no sooner escaped her lips than mr grim wig who had been
affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with
a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his
features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder and indulged
in a prolonged and vacant stare then as if ashamed of having betrayed
so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into
his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted along
deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air
but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach

mr brow low was no less surprised although his astonishment was not
expressed in the same eccentric manner he drew his chair nearer to
miss may lies and said

dome the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which
nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce
any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once
induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in
possession of it

a bad oneill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled mr
grim wig speaking by some ventrilo qui al power without moving a muscle
of his face

he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose
colouring and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do
honour to many who have numbered his days six times over

im only sixty one said mr grim wig with the same rigid face and
as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve years old atleast i
dont see the application of that remark

do not heed my friend miss may lie said mrbrown low he does not
mean what he says

yes he does growled mr grim wig

no he does not said mrbrown low obviously rising in wrath a she
spoke

helle a this head if he doesnt growled mr grim wig

he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said mr
brownlow

and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded mr
grim wig knocking his stick upon the floor

having gone thusfar the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and
afterwards shook hands according to their in variable custom

now miss may lie said mrbrown low to return to the subject in
which your humanity is so much interested will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to promise that i
exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i
have been absent from this country my first impression that he had
imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob
me has been considerably shaken

rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a
few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left mr
brown lows house reserving nancy s information for that gentlemans
private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow
for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former
benefactor and friend

thank god said the old gentleman this is great happiness to me
great happiness but you have not told me where he is now miss may lie
you must pardon my finding fault with you but why not have brought
him

he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose

at this door cried the old gentleman with which he hurried out of
the room down the stairs up the coach steps and into the coach
without another word

when the room door closed behind him mr grim wig lifted up his head
and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot
described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and
the table sitting in it all the time after performing this evolution
he rose and limped as fast a she could up and down the room atleast a
dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed her without
the slightest preface

hush he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
proceeding dont be afraid i mold enough to be your grandfather
your ea sweet girl i like you here they are

in fact a she threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
seat mrbrown low returned accompanied by oliver whom mr grim wig
received very graciously and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf
rose may lie would have been well repaid

there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said
mrbrown low ringing the bell send mrs bed win here if you please

the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch and
dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders

why you get blinder everyday bed win said mrbrown low rather
testily

well that i do sir replied the old lady peoples eyes at my
time of life dont improve with age sir

i could have told you that rejoined mrbrown low but put on your
glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will
you

the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles but
olivers patience was not proof against this new trial and yielding to
his first impulse he sprang into her arms

god be good to me cried the old lady embracing him it is my
innocent boy

my dear old nurse cried oliver

he would comeback i knew he would said the old lady holding him in
her arms how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is
dressed again where have you been this long long while ah the same
sweet face but not so pale the same soft eye but not so sadi have
never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them everyday
side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone since i
was a light some young creature running on thus and now holding
oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to her and
passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul laughed and
wept upon his neck by turns

leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure mrbrown low led
the way into another room and there heard from rose a full narration
of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise
and perplexity rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in
her friend mr los berne in the first instance the old gentleman
considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold
solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself to afford him an
early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged
that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and
that in the meantime mrs may lie should be cautiously informed of all
that had occurred these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver
returned home

rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath
nancy s history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a
shower of mingled threats and execration s threatened to make her the
first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs blathers and duff
and actually put on his hat preparatory to sally in gforth to obtain the
assistance of those worthies and doubtless he would in this first
outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments
consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in
part by corresponding violence on the side of mrbrown low who was
himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and
representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his
hot brained purpose

then what the devil is to be done said the impetuous doctor when
they had rejoined the two ladies are we to pass a vote of thanks to
all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred
pounds or so a piece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some
slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver

not exactly that rejoined mrbrown low laughing but we must
proceed gently and with great care

gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor id send them one and all
to

nevermind where interposed mrbrown low but reflect whether
sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view

what object asked the doctor

simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the
inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently
deprived

ah said mr los berne cooling himself with his pocket handkerchief
i almost forgot that

you see pursued mrbrown low placing this poor girl entirely out
of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these
scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should
webring about

hanging a few of them atleast in all probability suggested the
doctor and transporting the rest

very good replied mrbrown low smiling but no doubt they will
bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step
into forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
quixotic act indirect opposition to our own interest or atleast to
olivers which is the same thing

how inquired the doctor

thus it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in
getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man
monks upon his knees that can only be done by stratagem and by
catching him when he is not surrounded by these people for suppose he
were apprehended we have no proof against him he is not even so far
as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in
any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely
that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to
prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth
would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes
be deaf dumb blind and an idiot

then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether
you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest
intentions but really

do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said mr
brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak the promise
shall be kept i dont think it will in the slightest degree
interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any
precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to
ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the
understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law
or if she will not or can not do that to procure from her such an
account of his haunts and description of his personas will enable us
to identify him she can not be seen until next sunday night this is
tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime were main perfectly
quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself

although mr los berne received with many wry faces a proposal involving
a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course
occurred to him just then and as both rose and mrs may lie sided very
strongly with mrbrown low that gentlemans proposition was carried
unanimously

i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grim wig he
is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material
assistance to us i should say that he was breda lawyer and quitted
the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of
course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not
you must determine for yourselves

i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in
mine said the doctor

we must put it to the vote replied mrbrown low who may he be

that ladys son and this young ladys very old friend said the
doctor motioning towards mrs may lie and concluding with an
expressive glance at her niece

rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this
motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority and harry may lie and
mr grim wig were accordingly added to the committee

we stay in town of course said mrs may lie while there remains
the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the
object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to
remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that
any hope remains

good rejoined mrbrown low and as i see on the faces about me a
disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to
corroborate oliver stale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me
stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may
deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story believe
me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite
hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and
disappointments already quite numerous enough comes upper has been
announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will
have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company
and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the
world

with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs may lie and
escorted her into the supper room mr los berne followed leading rose
and the council was for the present effectually broken up




chapter xlii
an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius
becomes a public character in the metropolis


upon the night when nancy having lulled mr sikes to sleep hurried on
herself imposed mission to rose may lie there advanced towards london
by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that
this history should bestow some attention

they were a man and woman or perhaps they would be better described as
a male and female for the former was one of those long limbed
knock k need shambling bony people to whom it is difficult to assign
any precise age looking as they do when they are yet boys like
under grown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys the
woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been
to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back
her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely
dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel
wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough this
circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual
extent enabled him with much ease to keep some half dozen paces in
advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an
impatient jerk of the head as if reproaching her tardiness and urging
her to greater exertion

thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any
object with insight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider
passage for the mail coaches which were whirling out of town until
they passed through highgate archway when the foremost traveller
stopped and called impatiently to his companion

come on can tyer what a lazybones yer are charlotte

its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost
breathless with fatigue

heavy what are yer talking about what are yer made for rejoined
the male traveller changing his own little bundle a she spoke to the
other shoulder oh there yer are resting again well if yer a int
enough to tire anybody s patience out i dont know what is

is it much farther asked the woman resting herself against a bank
and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face

much farther yer as good as there said the long legged tramper
pointing out before him look there those are the lights of london

they re a good two mile off atleast said the woman despond ingly

nevermind whether they re two mile of for twenty said noah
clay pole for he it was but get up and come on or ill kick yer and
so i give yer notice

as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and a she crossed the road
while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution
the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his
side

where do you mean to stop for the night noah she asked after they
had walked a few hundred yards

how should i know replied noah whose temper had been considerably
impaired by walking

near i hope said charlotte

no not near replied mr clay pole there not near so dont think
it

why not

when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough
without any why or because either replied mr clay pole with dignity

well you need nt be so cross said his companion

a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very
first public house outside the town so that sower berry if he come up
after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart
with handcuffs on said mr clay pole i najee ringtone no i shall
go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop
till we come to the very out of the way est house i can set eyes on
co dyer may thanks yer stars ive got ahead for if we hadnt gone
at first the wrong road a purpose and comeback across country yer d
have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady and serve yer
right for being a fool

i know i a int as cunning as you are replied charlotte but dont
put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up you
would have been if i had been anyway

yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said mr
clay pole

i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte

did i keep it asked mr clay pole

no you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you
are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm
through his

this was indeed the case but as it was not mr clay poles habit to
repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be
observed injustice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte
to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be
found on her which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his
innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of
escape of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of
his motives and they walked on very lovingly together

in pursuance of this cautious plan mr clay pole went on without
halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely
judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that
london began in earnest just pausing to observe which appeared the
most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he
crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of
the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and
smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst
that improvement has left in the midst of london

through these streets noah clay pole walked dragging charlotte after
him now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole
external character of some small public house now jogging on again as
some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his
purpose at length he stopped in front of one more humble in
appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen and having crossed
over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced
his intention of putting up there for the night

so give us the bundle said noah un strapping it from the womans
shoulders and slinging it over his own and dont yer speak except
when yer spoke to whats the name of the house thr three what

cripples said charlotte

three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too now then
keep close at my heels and come along with these injunction she
pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house
followed by his companion

there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows
on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper he stared very hard at
noah and noah stared very hard at him

if noah had been attired in his charity boys dress there might have
been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide but a she had
discarded the coat and badge and wore a shorts mock frock over his
leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting
so much attention in a public house

is this the three cripples asked noah

that is the da be of this o use replied the jew

a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country
recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her
attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and
perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise we want to sleep here
tonight

ib dot cert aid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite
but ill id quire

show us the tap and give usa bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
while yer inquiring will yer said noah

barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting
the required viands before them having done which he informed the
travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable
couple to their refreshment

now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps
lower so that any person connected with the house un drawing a small
curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the
last named apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only
look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of
being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between
which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but
could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable
distinctness their subject of conversation the landlord of the house
had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes
and barney had only just returned from making the communication above
related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into
the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils

hush said barneys trade gers id the next roo b

strangers repeated the oldman in a whisper

a had ru buds too added barney frob the cut try but sub thig in
your way or ibb i staked

fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest

mounting as tool he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass
from which secret post he could see mr clay pole taking cold beef from
the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses
of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking a this
pleasure

aha he whispered looking round to barney i like that fellows
look shed be of use to us he know show to train the girl already
dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em
talk let me hear em

he again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the
partition listened attentively with a subtle and eager lookup on his
face that might have ap pertained to some old goblin

so i mean to be a gentleman said mr clay pole kicking out his legs
and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had
arrived too late to hear no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a
gentlemans life for me and if yer like yer shall be a lady

i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte but tills
a int to be emptied everyday and people to get clear off after it

tills be blowed said mr clay pole theres more things besides
tills to be emptied

what do you mean asked his companion

pockets womens ridicules houses mail coaches banks said mr
clay pole rising with the porter

but you cant do all that dear said charlotte

i shall lookout to get into company with them as can replied noah
theyll be able to make us useful some way or another why you
yourself are worth fifty women in ever see such a precious sly and
deceitful cree tur as yer can be when i let yer

l or how nice it is to hear yer say so exclaimed charlotte
imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face

there that ll do dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross
with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity i should
like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of em and
folle ring em about unbeknown to themselves that would suit me if
there was good profit and if we could only get in with some gentleman
of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twenty pound note youve
got especially as we dont very well know how to get rid of it
ourselves

after expressing this opinion mr clay pole looked into the porter pot
with an aspect of deep wisdom and having well shaken its contents
nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught where with he
appeared greatly refreshed he was meditating another when the sudden
opening of the door and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him

the stranger was mr fagin and very amiable he looked and a very low
bow he made a she advanced and setting himself down at the nearest
table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney

a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin
rubbing his hands from the country i see sir

how do yer see that asked noah clay pole

we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing
from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two
bundles

yer a sharp feller said noah haha only hear that charlotte

why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew
sinking his voice to a confidential whisper and thats the truth

fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his
right forefinger a gesture which noah attempted to imitate though not
with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large
enough for the purpose however mr fagin seemed to interpret the
endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put
about the liquor which barney reappeared within a very friendly
manner

good stuff that observed mr clay pole smacking his lips

dear said fagin a man need be always emptying a till or a pocket
or a womans reticule or a house or a mail coach or a bank if he
drinks it regularly

mr clay pole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he
fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a
countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror

dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer ha
ha it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance it was very
lucky it was only me

i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs
like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well a she could
under his chair it was all her doing yer ve got it now charlotte
yer know yer have

no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin
glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two
bundles im in that way myself and i like you for it

in what way asked mr clay pole a little recovering

in that way of business rejoined fagin and so are the people of
the house youve hit the right nail upon the head and areas safe
here as you could be there is not a safer place in all this town than
is the cripples that is when i like to make it so and i have taken a
fancy to you and the young woman so ive said the word and you may
make your minds easy

noah clay poles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but
his body certainly was not for he shuffled and writhed about into
various uncouth positions eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled
fear and suspicion

ill tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by
dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements i have got a friend
that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right
way where you can take whatever department of the business you think
will suit you best at first and be taught all the others

yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah

what advantage would it be to me to be anything else inquired fagin
shrugging his shoulders here let me have a word with you outside

theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting
his legs by gradual degrees abroad again shell take the luggage
upstairs the while charlotte see to them bundles

this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed
without the slightest demur and charlotte made the best of her way off
with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out

shes kept tolerably well under a int she he asked a she resumed
his seat in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal

quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder you re
a genius my dear

why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah but
i say shell be back if yer lose time

now what do you think said fagin if you was to like my friend
could you do better than join him

is he in a good way of business thats where it is responded noah
winking one of his little eyes

the top of the tree employs a power of hands has the very best
society in the profession

regular town made rs asked mr clay pole

not a countryman among em and i dont think hed take you even on
my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just
now replied fagin

should i have to handover said noah slapping his breeches pocket

it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most
decided manner

twenty pound though its alot of money

not when its in a note you cant get rid of retorted fagin number
and date taken i suppose payment stopped at the bank a hits not
worth much to him itll have to goabroad and he couldnt sell it for
a great deal in the market

when could i see him asked noah doubtfully

tomorrow morning

where

here

um said noah whats the wages

live like a gentleman board and lodging pipes and spirits free half
of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied mr
fagin

whether noah clay pole whose rapacity was none of the least
comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he
been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful but as here collected
that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new
acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely
things had come to pass he gradually relented and said he thought
that would suit him

but yer see observed no a has she will be able to do a good deal
i should like to take something very light

a little fancy work suggested fagin

ah something of that sort replied noah what do you think would
suit me now something not too trying for the strength and not very
dangerous you know thats the sort of thing

i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my
dear said fagin my friend wants somebody who would do that well
very much

why i did mention that and i shouldnt mind turning my hand to it
sometimes rejoined mr clay pole slowly but it wouldnt pay by
itself you know

thats true observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate
no it might not

what do you think then asked noah anxiously regarding him
something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not
much more risk than being at home

what do you think of the old ladies asked fagin theresa good
deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running
round the corner

dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes asked noah
shaking his head i dont think that would answer my purpose a int
there any other line open

stop said fagin laying his hand on noahs knee the kinch inlay

whats that demanded mr clay pole

the kinch ins my dear said fagin is the young children thats sent
on errands by their mothers with sixpence sand shillings and the lay
is just to take their money away theyve always got it ready in their
hands then knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if
there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt
itself hahaha

haha roared mr clay pole kicking up his legs in an ecstasy
lord that sth everything

to be sure it is replied fagin and you can have a few good beats
chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like
that where they re always going errands and you can upset as many
kinch in sas you want any hour in the day hahaha

with this fagin poked mr clay pole in the side and they joined in a
burst of laughter both long and loud

well thats all right said noah when he had recovered himself and
charlotte had returned what time tomorrow shall we say

will ten do asked fagin adding as mr clay pole nodded assent
what name shall i tell my good friend

mr bolter replied noah who had prepared himself for such
emergency mrmorris bolter this is mrs bolter

mrs bolters humble servant said fagin bowing with grotesque
politeness i hope i shall know her better very shortly

do you hear the gentleman charlotte thundered mr clay pole

yes noah dear replied mrs bolter extending her hand

she calls me no a has a sort of fond way of talking said mrmorris
bolter late clay pole turning to fagin you understand

oh yes i understand perfectly replied fagin telling the truth for
once goodnight goodnight

with many a die us and good wishes mr fagin went his way noah
clay pole be speaking his good ladys attention proceeded to enlighten
her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness
and air of superiority becoming not only a member of the sterner sex
but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on
the kinch inlay in london and its vicinity




chapter xliii
where in is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble


and so it was you that was your own friend was it asked mr
clay pole otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into
between them he had removed next day to fagin s house codi thought
as much last night

every mans his own friend my dear replied fagin with his most
insinuating grin he hasnt as good a one as himself anywhere

except sometimes replied morris bolter assuming the air of a man of
the world some people are nobodys enemies but their own yer know

dont believe that said fagin when a mans his own enemy its
only because hes too much his own friend not because hes careful for
everybody but himself pooh pooh there a int such a thing in nature

there ough nt to be if there is replied mr bolter

that stands to reason some conjurer s say that number three is the
magic number and some say number seven its neither my friend
neither its number one

haha cried mr bolter number one forever

in a little community like ours my dear said fagin who felt it
necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one
without considering me too as the same and all the other young
people

oh the devil exclaimed mr bolter

you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we
are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must
be so for instance its your object to take care of number
one meaning yourself

certainly replied mr bolter yer about right there

well you cant take care of yourself number one without taking care
of me number one

number two you mean said mr bolter who was largely endowed with
the quality of selfishness

no i dont retorted fagin im of the same importance to you as
you are to yourself

i say interrupted mr bolter yer a very nice man and im very
fond of yer but we a int quite so thick together as all that comes
to

only think said fagin shrugging his shoulders and stretching out
his hands only consider youve done what savery pretty thing and
what iloveyou for doing but what at the same time would put the
cravat round your throat thats so very easily tied and so very
difficult to un loose in plain english the halter

mr bolter put his hand to his neckerchief as if he felt it
in conveniently tight and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not
in substance

the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly
finger post which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway to keep in
the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with
you

of course it is replied mr bolter what do yer talkabout such
things for

only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his
eyebrows to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little
business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the
second my number one the more you value your number one the more
careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what it old you at
first that a regard for number one holds us all together and must do
so unless we would all goto pieces in company

thats true rejoined mr bolter thoughtfully oh yer a cunning
old codger

mr fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no
mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a
sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should
entertain in the outset of their acquaintance to strengthen an
impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by
acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his
operations blending truth and fiction together as best served his
purpose and bringing both to bear with so much art that mr bolters
respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with
a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken

its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
heavy losses said fagin my best hand was taken from me yesterday
morning

you dont mean to say he died cried mr bolter

no no replied fagin not so bad as that not quite so bad

what i suppose he was

wanted interposed fagin yes he was wanted

very particular inquired mr bolter

no replied fagin not very he was charged with attempting to pick
a pocket and they found a silver snuff box on him his own my dear
his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it they
remanded him till today for they thought they knew the owner ah he
was worth fifty boxes and id give the price of as many to have him
back you should have known the dodger my dear you should have known
the dodger

well but i shall know him i hope dont yer think so said mr
bolter

im doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh if they dont get
any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we shall
have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do its a case
of lagging they know what a clever lad he is hell be a life r
theyll make the artful nothing less than a life r

what do you mean by lagging and a life r demanded mr bolter whats
the good of talking in that way to me why dont yer speak so as i can
understand yer

fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the
vulgar tongue and being interpreted mr bolter would have been
informed that they represented that combination of words
transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry
of masterbates with his hands in his breeches pockets and his face
twisted into a look of semi comical woe

its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had
been made known to each other

what do you mean

theyve found the gentleman as owns the box two or three more sa
coming to den tify him and the artful s booked for a passage out
replied masterbates i must have a full suit of mourning fagin and
a hat band to w is it him in afore he sets out upon his travels to
think of jack dawkins lum my jack the dodger the artful dodger going
abroad for a common two penny halfpenny sneeze box in ever though the d
a done it under a gold watch chain and seals at the lowest oh why
didn the rob some rich old gentleman of all his wa lables and go out
as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour nor
glory

with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master
bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
despondency

what do you talkabout his having neither honour nor glory for
exclaimed fagin darting an angry look a this pupil was n the always
the top sawyer among you all is there one of you that could touch him
or come near him on any scent eh

not one replied masterbates in a voice rendered husky by regret
not one

then what do you talk of replied fagin angrily what are you
blubbering for

cause it isnt on the record is it said charley chafed into
perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets
cause it cant come out in the dict ment cause nobody will never
know half of what he was how will he stand in the newgate calendar
p raps not be there at all oh my eye my eye wot a blow it is

haha cried fagin extending his righthand and turning to mr
bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the
palsy see what a pride they take in their profession my dear a int
it beautiful

mr bolter nodded assent and fagin after contemplating the grief of
charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to
that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder

nevermind charley said fagin soothingly itll come out itll be
sure to come out theyll all know what a clever fellow he was hell
show it himself and not disgrace his old pals and teachers think how
young he is too what a distinction charley to be lagged a this time
of life

well it is a honour that is said charley a little consoled

he shall have all he wants continued the jew he shall be kept in
the stone jug charley like a gentleman like a gentleman with his
beer everyday and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with if he
cant spend it

no shall he though cried charley bates

ayth a the shall replied fagin and well have a bigwig charley
one thats got the greatest gift of the gab to carry on his defence
and he shall make a speech for himself too if he like sandwell read
it all in the papers artful dodger shrieks of laughter here the court
was convulsed eh charley eh

haha laughed masterbates what a lark that would be wouldnt
it fagin i say how the artful would bother em would n the

would cried fagin he shall he will

ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands

i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his
pupil

so do i cried charley bates hahaha so do ii see it all
afore me upon my soul id of ag in what a game what a regular game
all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of
emas intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges owns on making
as pee charter dinner hahaha

in fact mr fagin had so well humoured his young friends eccentric
disposition that masterbates who had at first been disposed to
consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now
looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and
exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time
when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of
displaying his abilities

we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other
said fagin let me think

shall i go asked charley

not for the world replied fagin are you mad my dear stark mad
that you d walk into the very place where no charley no one is
enough to lose at a time

you dont mean to go yourself i suppose said charley with a
humorous leer

that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head

then why dont you send this new cove asked masterbate slaying his
hand on noahs arm nobody knows him

why if he didnt mind observed fagin

mind interposed charley what should he have to mind

really nothing my dear said fagin turning to mr bolter really
nothing

oh i daresay about that yer know observed noah backing towards
the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm non on one
of that its not in my department that a int

wot department has he got fagin inquired masterbates surveying
noah slank form with much disgust the cutting away when theres
anything wrong and the eating all the witt les when theres everything
right is that his branch

nevermind retorted mr bolter and dont yer take liberties with
yer superiors little boy or yer ll find yerself in the wrong shop

masterbates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it
was sometime before fagin could interpose and represent to mr bolter
that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police office
that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had
engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to
the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of
having resorted to it for shelter and that if he were properly
disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in
london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which
he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will

persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much
greater degree by his fear of fagin mr bolter at length consented
with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition by fagin s
directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoner s
frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings all of which articles
the jew had at hand he was likewise furnished with a fel that well
garnished with turnpike tickets and a carters whip thus equipped he
was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent
garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his
curiousity and a she was as awkward ungainly and raw boned a fellow
as need be mr fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to
perfection

these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs
and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by
masterbates through dark and winding ways to within a very short
distance of bowstreet having described the precise situation of the
office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk
straight up the passage and when he got into the side and pull off
his hat a she went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on
alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting

noah clay pole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually
followed the directions he had received which masterbates being
pretty well acquainted with the locality were so exact that he was
enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question
or meeting with any interruption by the way

he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who
were huddled together in a dirty f rows y room at the upper end of which
was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the
prisoners on the lefthand against the walla box for the witnesses in
the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right the awful
locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed
the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they
could the full majesty of justice

there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to
their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a
couple of policemen andaman in plainclothes whole ant over the
table a jailer stood reclining against the dock rail tapping his nose
listlessly with a large key except when here pressed an undue tendency
to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence or looked
sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the gravity of
justice was disturbed by feeble cries half smothered in the mothers
shawl from some meagre infant the rooms melt close and unwholesome
the walls were dirt discoloured and the ceiling blackened there was
an old smoky bust over the mantel shelf and a dusty clock above the
dock the only thing present that seemed to go on as it ought for
depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance with both had left
a taint on all the animate matter hardly less unpleasant than the
thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it

noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger but although there were
several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be
supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all
answering the description given him of mr dawkins was to be seen he
waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women
being committed for trial went flaunting out and then was quickly
relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once
could be no other than the object of his visit

it was indeed mr dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big
coat sleeves tucked up as usual his lefthand in his pocket and his
hat in his righthand preceded the jailer with a rolling gait
altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested
in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful
si tivation for

hold your tongue will you said the jailer

i man englishman a in tire joined the dodger where are my
pri wi leges

youll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and
pepper with em

well see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to
say to the beaks if i dont replied mr dawkins now the nwot is
this here business i shall thank the mad gst rates to dispose of this
here little affair and not to keep me while they read the paper for
ive got an appointment with a genel man in the city and asia maman
of my word and wery punctual in business matter shell go away if i
a int there to my time and the npr a pst her wont bean action for
damage against the mask ep me away ohno certainly not

at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a
view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to
communicate the names of them two files as was on the bench which so
tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as master
bates could have done if he had heard the request

silence there cried the jailer

what is this inquired one of the magistrates

a pick pocketing case your worship

has the boy ever been here before

he ought to have been a many times replied the jailer he has been
pretty well everywhere else i know him well your worship

oh you know me do you cried the artful making a note of the
statement wery good that sa case of deformation of character any
way

here there was another laugh and another cry of silence

now then where are the witnesses said the clerk

ah thats right added the dodger where are they i should like to
see em

this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward
who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in
a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief there from which being a very
old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own
countenance for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon
a she could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon
his person a silver snuff box with the owners name engraved upon the
lid this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court
guide and being then and the represents wore that the snuff box was
his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had
disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to he had also
remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making
his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him

have you anything to ask this witness boy said the magistrate

i wouldnt a base myself by descending to hold no conversation with
him replied the dodger

have you anything to say at all

do you hear his worship ask if youve anything to say inquired the
jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow

i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an air of
abstraction did you redress yourself to me my man

in ever see such an out and out young waga bond your worship
observed the officer with a grin do you mean to say anything you
young shaver

no replied the dodger not here for this a int the shop for
justice besides which my attorney is a breakfasting this morning with
the wice president of the house of commons but i shall have something
to say elsewhere and so will he and so will a wery numerous and
spec table circle of acquaintance as ll make them beaks wish they d
never been born or that they d got their footmen to hang em up to
their own hat pegs afore they let em come out this morning to try it
on upon me ill

there hes fully committed interposed the clerk take him away

come on said the jailer

oh a hill come on replied the dodger brushing his hat with the
palm of his hand ah to the bench its no use your looking
frightened i wont show you no mercy not aha porth of it youll
pay for this my fine fellers i wouldnt be you for something i
wouldnt go free now if you was to fall down on your knees and ask
me here carry me off to prison take me away

with these last words the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the
collar threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary
business of it and then grinning in the officers face with great
glee and self approval

having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell noah made the
best of his wayback to where he had left masterbates after waiting
here sometime he was joined by that young gentleman who had
prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully
abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new friend had not
been followed by any impertinent person

the two hastened back together to bear to mr fagin the animating news
that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up and
establishing for himself a glorious reputation




chapter xliv
the time arrives for nancy to redeem her pledge to rose may lies he
fails


adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the
girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of
the steps he had taken wrought upon her mind she remembered that both
the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes which
had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was
trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion vile as those
schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were
her feelings towards fagin who had led her step by step deeper and
deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape
still there were times when even towards him she felt some
relenting l esther disclosure should bring him within their on grasp
he had so long eluded and he should fall at last richly a she merited
such a fate by her hand

but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix
itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by
any consideration her fears for sikes would have been more powerful
inducements to recoil while there was yet time but she had stipulated
that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which
could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a
refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her and
what more could she do she was resolved

though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they
forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too
she grew pale and thin even within a few days at times she took no
heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where
once she would have been the loudest at other times she laughed
without merriment and was noisy without a moment afterwards she sat
silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the
very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even
these indications that she wasilla tease and that her thoughts were
occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the
course of discussion by her companions

it was sunday night and the bell of the nearest church struck the
hour sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen the
girl looked up from the low seaton which she crouched and listened
too eleven

an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look
out and returning to his seat dark and heavy it is too a goodnight
for business this

ah replied fagin what a pity bill my dear that theres none
quite ready to be done

you re right for once replied sikes gruffly it is a pity for im
in the humour too

fagin sighed and shook his head despond ingly

we must makeup for lost time when weve got things into a good train
that salli know said sikes

thats the way to talk my dear replied fagin venturing top at him
on the shoulder it does me good to hear you

does you good does it cried sikes well so be it

hahaha laughed fagin as if he were relieved by even this
concession you re like yourself tonight bill quite like yourself

i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jews hand

it make you nervous bill reminds you of being nabbed does it said
fagin determined not to be offended

reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes there never
was another man with such a face as your sunless it was your father
and i suppose he is singe ing his grizzled redbeard by this time
unless you came straight from the old un without any father at all
betwixt you which i shouldnt wonder at abit

fagin offered no reply to this compliment but pulling sikes by the
sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of
the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving
the room

hallo cried sikes nance where s the gal going to at this time of
night

not far

what answers that retorted sikes do you hear me

i dont know where replied the girl

the nido said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because
he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed nowhere
sitdown

im not well it old you that before rejoined the girl i want a
breath of air

put your head out of the winder replied sikes

theres not enough there said the girl i want it in the street

then you wont have it replied sikes with which assurance he rose
locked the door took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her
head flung it up to the top of an old press there said the robber
now stop quietly where you are will you

its not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me said the girl
turning very pale what do you mean bill do you know what you re
doing

know what i moh cried sikes turning to fagin shes out of her
senses you know or shed arent talk to me in that way

youll drive me on the something desperate muttered the girl placing
both hands upon her breast as though to keep down by force some
violent outbreak let me go will you this minute this instant

no said sikes

tell him to let me go fagin he had better itll be better for him
do you hear me cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground

hear you repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her
aye and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have
such a grip on your throat as ll tear some of that screaming voice out
wot has come over you you jade wot is it

let me go said the girl with great earnestness then sitting herself
down on the floor before the door she said bill let me go you
dont know what you are doing you dont indeed for only one
hour do do

cut my limbs off one by one cried sikes seizing her roughly by the
arm if i dont think the gals stark raving mad get up

not till you let me go not till you let me go never never screamed
the girl sikes looked on for a minute watching his opportunity and
suddenly pinion ing her hands dragged her struggling and wrestling with
him by the way into a small room adjoining where he sat himself on a
bench and thrusting her into a chair held her down by forces he
struggled and implored by turns until twelve oclock had struck and
then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further
with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out
that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin

whew said the house breaker wiping the perspiration from his face
wot a precious strange gal that is

you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully you may say
that

wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you
think asked sikes come you should know her better than me wot
does it mean

obstinacy womans obstinacy i suppose my dear

well i suppose it is growled sikes i thought i had tamed her but
shes as bad as ever

worse said fagin thoughtfully in ever knew her like this for such
a little cause

nor i said sikes i think shes got a touch of that fever in her
blood yet and it wont come out eh

like enough

ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes
took that way again said sikes

fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment

she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched
on my back and you like a black hearted wolf as you are kept yourself
aloof said sikes we was poor too all the time and i think one
way or other its worried and fretted her and that being shutup here
so long has made her restless eh

that sit my dear replied the jew in a whisper hush

a she uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her
former sea there yes were swollen and red she rocked herself to and
fro tossed her head and after a little time burst out laughing

why now she son the other tack exclaimed sikes turning a look of
excessive surprise on his companion

fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few
minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour whispering
sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat
and bade him goodnight he paused when he reached the room door and
looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs

light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe its a pity he
should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers show him
a light

nancy followed the oldman downstairs with a candle when they reached
the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close to the
girl said in a whisper

what is it nancy dear

what do you mean replied the girl in the same tone

the reason of all this replied fagin if hehe pointed with his
skinny forefinger up the stairs is so hard with you hesa brute
nance a brute beast why dont you

well said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching
here ar and his eyes looking into hers

no matter just now well talk of this again you have a friend in me
nance a staunch friend i have the means at hand quiet and close if
you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog like a dog worse
than his dog for he humours him sometimes come tomei say come to
me he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of old nance

i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least
emotion goodnight

she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said
goodnight again in a steady voice and answering his parting look
with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them

fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were
working within his brain he had conceived the idea not from what had
just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by
degrees that nancy wearied of the house breakers brutality had
conceived an attachment for some new friend her altered manner her
repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the
interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and
added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him
atleast almost matter of certainty the object of this new liking was
not among his myrmidon she would be a valuable acquisition with such
an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured without
delay

there was another and a darker object to be gained sikes knew too
much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the
wounds were hidden the girl must know well that if she shook him
off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely
wreaked to the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of life on the
object of her more recent fancy

with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that
she would consent to poison him women have done such things and
worse to secure the same object before now there would be the
dangerous villain the man i hate gone another secured in his place
and my influence over the girl with a knowledge of this crime to back
it unlimited

these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he
sat alone in the house breakers room and with them uppermost in his
thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of
sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting there
was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to
understand his meaning the girl clearly comprehended it her glance at
parting showed that

but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and
that was one of the chief ends to be attained how thought fagin as
he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her what new
power can i acquire

such brains are fertile in expedients if without extracting a
confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her
altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of
whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs
could he not secure her compliance

i can said fagin almost aloud she durst not refuse me then not
for her life not for her life i have it all the means are ready and
shall be set to work i shall have you yet

he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards
the spot where he had left the bolder villain and went on his way
busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he
wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy
crushed with every motion of his fingers




chapter xlv
noah clay pole is employed by fagin on a secret mission


the oldman was up be times next morning and waited impatiently for
the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed
interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious
assault on the breakfast

bolter said fagin drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite
morris bolter

well here i am returned noah whats the matter dont yer ask me
to do anything till i have done eating that sa great fault in this
place yer never get time enough over yer meals

you can talk as you eat cant you said fagin cursing his dear
young friends greediness from the very bottom of his heart

oh yes i can talk i get on better when i talk said noah cutting a
monstrous slice of bread where s charlotte

out said fagin i sent her out this morning with the other young
woman because i wanted us to be alone

oh said noah i wish yer d ordered her to make some buttered toast
first well talk away yer wont interrupt me

there seemed indeed no great fear of anything interrupting him a she
had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of
business

you did well yesterday my dear said fagin beautiful six
shillings and nine pence halfpenny on the very first day the kinch in
lay will be a fortune to you

dont you forget to add three pint pots and a milk can said mr
bolter

no no my dear the pint pots were great strokes of genius but the
milk can was a perfect masterpiece

pretty well i think for a beginner remarked mr bolter
complacently the pots i took of fairy railings and the milk can was
standing by itself outside a public house i thought it might get rusty
with the rain or catch cold yer know eh hahaha

fagin affected to laugh very heartily and mr bolter having had his
laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk
of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second

i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a
piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution

i say rejoined bolter dont yer go shoving me into danger or
sending me anymore oyer police offices that dont suit me that
dont and so i tell yer

thats not the smallest danger in it not the very smallest said the
jew its only to dodge a woman

an old woman demanded mr bolter

a young one replied fagin

i can do that pretty well i know said bolter i was a regular
cunning sneak when i was at school what am i to dodge her for not
to

not to do anything but to tell me where she goes who she sees and
if possible what she says to remember the street if it is a street
or the house if it is a house and to bring me back all the
information you can

what ll yer give me asked noah setting down his cup and looking
his employer eagerly in the face

if you do it well a pound my dear one pound said fagin wishing
to interest him in the scent as much as possible and thats what i
never gave yet for any job of work where there wasnt valuable
consideration to be gained

who is she inquired noah

one of us

ohl or cried noah curling up his no seyer doubtful of her are
yer

she has found out some new friends my dear and i must know who they
are replied fagin

i see said noah just to have the pleasure of knowing them if
they re respectable people eh hahaha im your man

i knew you would be cried fagin elated by the success of his
proposal

of course of course replied noah where is she whereami to wait
for her whereami to go

all that my dear you shall hear from me ill point her out at the
proper time said fagin you keep ready and leave the rest to me

that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and
equipped in his carters dress ready to turnout at a word from fagin
six nights passed six long weary nights and on each fagin came home
with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was not yet
time on the seventh he returned earlier and with an exultation he
could not conceal it was sunday

she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im
sure for she has been alone all day and the man she is afraid of will
not be back much before daybreak come with me quick

noah started up without saying a word for the jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him they left the house
stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at
length before a public house which noah recognised as the same in
which he had slepton the night of his arrival in london

it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed it opened softly
on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle they entered without noise
and the door was closed behind them

scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words
fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of
glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in
the adjoining room

is that the woman he asked scarcely above his breath

fagin nodded yes

icant see her face well whispered noah she is looking down and
the candle is behind her

stay there whispered fagin he signed to barney who withdrew in an
instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of
snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking
to the girl caused her to raise her face

i see her now cried the spy

plainly

i should know her among a thousand

he hastily descended as the room door opened and the girl came out
fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and
they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered

hist cried the lad who held the door dow

noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out

to the left whispered the lad take the left had and keep od the
other side

he did so and by the light of the lamps saw the girls retreating
figure already at some distance before him he advanced as near a she
considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the
better to observe her motions she looked nervously round twice or
thrice and once stopped to lett women who were following close behind
her pass on she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to walk
with a steadier and firmer step the spy preserved the same relative
distance between them and followed with his eye upon her




chapter xlvi
the appointment kept


the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures
emerged on london bridge one which advanced with a swift and rapid
step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in
quest of some expected object the other figure was that of a man who
slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance
accommodated hi space to hers stopping when she stopped and as she
moved again creeping stealthily on but never allowing himself in the
ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps thus they crossed
the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the woman
apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot passengers
turned back the movement was sudden but he who watched her was not
thrown off his guard by it for shrinking into one of the recesses
which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning over the parapet
the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to pass on the
opposite pavement when she was about the same distance in advance as
she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed her again
at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped the man stopped too

it was a very dark night the day had been unfavourable and at that
hour and place there were few people stirring such as there were
hurried quickly past very possibly without seeing but certainly
without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
of such of london s destitute population as chanced to take their way
over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or door less
hovel where into lay their heads they stood there in silence neither
speaking nor spoken to by anyone who passed

a mist hungover the river deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks
the old smoke stained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull
from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water
too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes the tower of old
saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the
giant warders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom but the
forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of
churches above were nearly all hidden from sight

the girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro closely watched
meanwhile by her hidden observer when the heavy bell of st pauls
tolled for the death of another day midnight had come upon the crowded
city the palace the night cellar the jail the madhouse the
chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face of
the corpse and the calm sleep of the child midnight was upon them all

the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by
a grey haired gentleman alighted from a hackney carriage within a
short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked
straight towards it they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement when
the girl started and immediately made towards them

they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who
entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it
immediately for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
up brushed against them indeed at that precise moment

not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here
come away out of the public road down the steps yonder

as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction
in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on

the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the
surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours
church form a landing stairs from the river to this spot the man
bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved and after
a moments survey of the place he began to descend

these stairs area part of the bridge they consist of three flights
just below the end of the second going down the stonewall on the
left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames at
this point the lower steps widen so that a person turning that angle
of the wallis necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who
chance to be above him if only a step the countryman looked hastily
round when he reached this point and as there seemed no better place
of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty of room he
slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there waited pretty
certain that they would come no lower and that even if he could not
hear what was said he could follow them again with safety

so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he
had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for
lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or
had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
conversation he was on the point of emerging from his hiding place
and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and
directly afterwards of voices almost close a this ear

he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely
breathing listened attentively

this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the
gentleman i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but
you see i am willing to humour you

to humour me cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed
you re considerate indeed sir to humour me well well its no
matter

why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose
can you have brought us to this strange place why not have let me
speak to you above there where it is light and there is something
stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole

it old you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you
there i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have
such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand

a fear of what asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her

i scarcely know of what replied the girl i wish i did horrible
thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that
has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day i was
reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things
came into the print

imagination said the gentleman soothing her

no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice ill swear i saw
coffin written in every page of the book in large black letters aye
and they carried one close to me in the streets tonight

there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman they have
passed me often

real ones rejoined the girl this was not

there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the
concealed listener crept a she heard the girl utter these words and
the blood chilled within him he had never experienced a greater relief
than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to
be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful
fancies

speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion poor
creatures he seems to need it

your haughty religious people would have held their headsup to see me
asia m tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the
girl oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks
as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth
and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud
instead of so much humbler

ah said the gentleman a turk turns his face after washing it
well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after
giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles
off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven
between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first

these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were
perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover
herself the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her

you were not here last sunday night he said

i couldnt come replied nancy i was kept by force

by whom

him that it old the young lady of before

you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope asked the old
gentleman

no replied the girl shaking her head its not very easy for me to
leave him unless he knows why i couldnt give him a drink of laudanum
before i came away

did he awake before you returned inquired the gentleman

no and neither he nor any of them suspect me

good said the gentleman now listen to me

i am ready replied the girl a she paused for a moment

this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to
some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly
a fortnight since i confess to you that i had doubts at first
whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe
you are

i am said the girl earnestly

i repeat that i firmly believe it to prove to you that i am disposed
to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the
secret whatever it maybe from the fear of this man monks but
if if said the gentleman he can not be secured or if secured
can not be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew

fagin cried the girl recoiling

that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman

i will not do it i will never do it replied the girl devil that
he is and worse than devil a she has been tomei will never do
that

you will not said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this
answer

never returned the girl

tell me why

for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the
lady knows and will standby me in i know she will for i have her
promise and for this other reason besides that bad life a she has
led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the
same courses together and ill not turn upon them who might any of
them have turned upon me but didnt bad as they are

then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he
had been aiming to attain put monks into my hands and leave him to
me to deal with

what if he turns against the others

i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him
there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in olivers
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye
and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free

and if it is not suggested the girl

then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to
justice without your consent in such a case i could show you reasons
i think which would induce you to yield it

have i the ladys promise for that asked the girl

you have replied rose my true and faithful pledge

monks would never learn how you knew what you do said the girl
after a short pause

never replied the gentleman the intelligence should be brought to
bear upon him that he could never even guess

i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the
girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words

after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so
she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by
name and situation the public house whence she had been followed that
night from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared as
if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
communicated when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the
place the best position from which to watch it without exciting
observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the
habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for
the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to
her recollection

heist all said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout
he has a lurking walk and a she walks constantly looks over his
shoulder first on one side and the non the other dont forget that
for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans
that you might almost tell him by that alone his face is dark like
his hair and eyes and although he cant be more than six or eight and
twenty withered and haggard his lips are often discoloured and
disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and
sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds why did you
start said the girl stopping suddenly

the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious
of having done so and begged her to proceed

part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at
the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times
he was covered up in a large cloak i think that salli can give you
to know him by stay though she added upon his throat so high that
you can see apart of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face
there is

abroad red mark like a burn or scald cried the gentleman

how s this said the girl you know him

the young lady uttered a cry of surprise and for a few moments they
were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe

i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence i should by your
description we shall see many people are singularly like each other
it may not be the same

a she expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he
took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell
from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he

now he said returning so it seemed by the sound to the spot where
he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance young
woman and i wish you to be the better for it what can i do to serve
you

nothing replied nancy

you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a
voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder
and more obdurate heart think now tell me

nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping you can do nothing to help
me i am past all hope indeed

you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman the past has
been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such
priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never
grants again but for the future you may hope i do not say that it
is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must
come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you
fear to remain herein some foreign country it is not only within the
compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you before
the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of
daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your
former associates and leave a sutter an absence of all trace behind
you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment come i
would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion
or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is
pestilence and death to you quit them all while there is time and
opportunity

she will be persuaded now cried the young lady she hesitate siam
sure

i fear not my dear said the gentleman

no siri do not replied the girl after a short struggle i am
chained to my old life i loathe and hate it now but i can not leave
it i must have gone too far to turn back and yeti dont know for if
you had spoken to me so sometime ago i should have laughed it off
but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me again
i must go home

home repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word

home lady rejoined the girl to such a home as i have raised for
myself with the work of my whole life let us part i shall be watched
or seen gogo if i have done you any service all i ask is that you
leave me and let me go my way alone

it is useless said the gentleman with a sigh we compromise her
safety perhaps by staying here we may have detained her longer than
she expected already

yes yes urged the girl you have

what cried the young lady can be the end of this poor creatures
life

what repeated the girl look before you lady look at that dark
water how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the
tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them it maybe
years hence or it maybe only months but i shall come to that at
last

do not speak thu spray returned the young lady sobbing

it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors
should replied the girl goodnight goodnight

the gentleman turned away

this purse cried the young lady take it for my sake that you may
have some resource in an hour of need and trouble

no replied the girl i have not done this for money let me have
that to think of and yet give me something that you have worn i
should like to have something no no not a ring your gloves or
handkerchief anything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet
lady there bless you god bless you goodnight goodnight

the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some
discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence seemed to
determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested

the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased

the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
appeared upon the bridge they stopped at the summit of the stairs

hark cried the young lady listening did she call i thought i
heard her voice

no my love replied mrbrown low looking sadly back she has not
moved and will not till we are gone

rose may lie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his
and led her with gentle force away as they disappeared the girl
sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and
vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears

after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for
some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious
glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his
hiding place and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in
the same manner a she had descended

peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that
he was unobserved noah clay pole darted away a this utmost speed and
made for the jews house as fast as his legs would carry him




chapter xlvii
fatal consequences


it was nearly two hours before daybreak that time which in the autumn
of the year maybe truly called the dead of night when the streets
are silent and deserted when even sounds appear to slumber and
profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream it was at this still
and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so
distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less
like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and
worried by an evil spirit

he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet
with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his side his righthand was raised to his lips and as absorbed in
though the hi this long black nails he disclosed among his toothless
gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats

stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah clay pole fast asleep
towards him the oldman sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and
then brought them back again to the candle which with along burnt
wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon
the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere

indeed they were mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme
hatred of the girl who had dared top alter with strangers and utter
distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter
disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of
detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all these were the passionate considerations which following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain
of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working a this
heart

he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take
the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted
by a footstep in the street

atlas the muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth at last

the bell rang gently a she spoke he crept upstairs to the door and
presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who
carried a bundle under one arm sitting down and throwing back his
outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes

there he said laying the bundle on the table take care of that
and do the most you can with it its been trouble enough to get i
thought i should have been here three hours ago

fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard
sat down again without speaking but he did not take his eyes off the
robber for an instant during this action and now that they sat over
against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his
lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions
which had mastered him that the house breaker involuntarily drew back
his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright

wot now cried sikes wot do you look ataman so for

fagin raised his righthand and shook his trembling forefinger in the
air but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the
moment gone

damme said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm hes
gone madi must look to myself here

no no rejoined fagin finding his voice its not you re not the
person bill ive no no fault to find with you

oh you havent havent you said sikes looking sternly at him and
ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket thats
lucky for one of us which one that is dont matter

ive got that to tell you bill said fagin drawing his chair
nearer will make you worse than me

aye returned the robber with an incredulous air tell away look
sharp or nance will think im lost

lost cried fagin she has pretty well settled that in her own
mind already

sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face
and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched
his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly

speak will you he said or if you dont it shall be for want of
breath open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words
out with it you thundering old cur out with it

suppose that lad that slaying there fagin began

sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not
previously observed him well he said resuming his former position

suppose that lad pursued fagin was top each to blow upon us
all first seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having
a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe
every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be
most easily taken suppose he was to do all this and besides to blow
upon a plant weve all been in more or less of his own fancy not
grabbed trapped tried ear wigged by the parson and brought to it on
bread and water but of his own fancy to please his own taste
stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us and
peach ing to them do you hear me cried the jew his eyes flashing
with rage suppose he did all this what then

what then replied sikes with a tremendous oath if he was left
alive till i came id grind his skull under their on heel of my boot
into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head

what if i did it cried fagin almost in a yell i that knows so
much and could hang so many besides myself

i dont know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at
the mere suggestion id do something in the jail that udget me put
in irons and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with
them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people i
should have such strength muttered the robber poi singh is brawny
arm that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over
it

you would

would i said the house breaker try me

if it was charley or the dodger or bet or

i dont care who replied sikes impatiently whoever it was id
serve them the same

fagin looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent
stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse
him sikes leant forward in his chair looking on with his hands upon
his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and
preparation was to end in

bolter bolter poor lad said fagin looking up with an expression
of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis
hes tired tired with watching for her so long watching for her
bill

wot dye mean asked sikes drawing back

fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him
into a sitting posture when his assumed name had been repeated several
times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked sleepily
about him

tell me that again once again just for him to hear said the jew
pointing to sikes a she spoke

tell yer what asked the sleepy noah shaking himself pettis hly

that about nancy said fagin clutching sikes by the wrist as if
to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough you
followed her

yes

to london bridge

yes

where she met two people

so she did

a gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before
who asked her to give up all her pals and monks first which she
did and to describe him which she did and to tell her what house it
was that we meet at and goto which she did and where it could be
best watched from which she did and what time the people went there
which she did she did all this she told it all every word without a
threat without a murmurs he did did she not cried fagin half mad
with fury

all right replied noah scratching his head thats just what it
was

what did they say about last sunday

about last sunday replied noah considering why it old yer that
before

again tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and
brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips

they asked her said noah who a she grew more wakeful seemed to
have a dawning perception who sikes was they asked her why she didnt
come last sunday as she promised she said she couldnt

why why tell him that

because she was forcibly kept at home by bill the man she had told
them of before replied noah

what more of him cried fagin what more of the man she had told
them of before tell him that tell him that

why that she couldnt very easily get out of doors unless he knew
where she was going to said noah and so the first time she went to
see the lady she hahaha it made me laugh when she said it that
it did she gave him a drink of laudanum

hells fire cried sikes breaking fiercely from the jew let me
go

flinging the oldman from him he rushed from the room and darted
wildly and furiously up the stairs

bill bill cried fagin following him hastily a word only a
word

the word would not have been exchanged but that the house breaker was
unable to open the door on which he was expending fruitless oaths and
violence when the jew came panting up

let me out said sikes dont speak to me its not safe let me
out i say

hear me speak a word rejoined fagin laying his hand upon the lock
you wont be

well replied the other

you wont be too violent bill

the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see
each others faces they exchange done brief glance there was a fire
in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken

i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now
useless not too violent for safety be crafty bill and not too
bold

sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which fagin had
turned the lock dashed into the silent streets

without one pause or moments consideration without once turning his
head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering
them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage
resolution his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw
seemed starting through his skin the robber held on his headlong
course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his
own door he opened it softly with a key strode lightly up the
stairs and entering his own room double locked the door and lifting
a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed

the girl was lying half dressed upon i the had roused her from her
sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look

get up said the man

it is you bill said the girl with an expression of pleasure a this
return

it is was the reply get up

there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the
candlestick and hurled it under the grate seeing the faint light of
early day without the girl rose to un draw the curtain

let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her theres enough
light for wo tive got to do

bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like
that at me

the robbers at regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils
and heaving breast and then grasping her by the head and throat
dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the
door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth

bill bill gasped the girl wrestling with the strength of mortal
fear ii wont scream or cry not once hear me speak to me tell me
what i have done

you know you she devil returned the robber suppressing his breath
you were watched tonight every word you said was heard

then spare my life for the love of heaven as i spared yours
rejoined the girl clinging to him bill dear bill you can not have
the heart to kill meoh think of all i have given up only this one
night for you you shall have time to think and save yourself this
crime i will not loose my hold you can not throw me off bill bill
for dear gods sake for your own for mines top before you spill my
blood i have been true to you upon my guilty soul i have

the man struggled violently to release his arms but those of the girl
were clasped round his and tear her a she would he could not tear
them away

bill cried the girl striving to lay her head upon his breast the
gentleman and that dear lady told me tonight of a home in some
foreign country where i could end my days in solitude and peace let me
see them again and beg the mon my knees to show the same mercy and
goodness to you and let us both leave this dreadful place and far
apart leadbetter lives and forget how we have lived except in
prayers and never see each other more it is never too late to repent
they told me so i feel it now but we must have time a little little
time

the house breaker free done armand grasped his pistol the certainty
of immediate detection if he fired flashed across his mind even in the
midst of his fury and he beat it twice with all the force he could
summon upon the upturned face that almost touched his own

she staggered and fell nearly blinded with the blood that rained down
from a deep gash in her forehead but raising herself with difficulty
on her knees drew from her bosom a white handkerchief rose may lies
own and holding it up in her folded hands as high towards heaven as
her feeble strength would allow breathed one prayer for mercy to her
maker

it was a ghastly figure to lookup on the murderer staggering backward
to the wall and shutting out the sight with his hand seized a heavy
club and struck her down




chapter xlviii
the flight of sikes


of all bad deeds that undercover of the darkness had been committed
within wide london s bounds since night hungover it that was the
worst of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning
air that was the foulest and most cruel

the sun the bright sun that brings back not light alone but new
life and hope and freshness to man burst upon the crowded city in
clear and radiant glory through costly coloured glass and paper mended
window through cathedral dome and rotten crevice it shed its equal
ray it lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay it did he
tried to shut it out but it would stream in if the sight had been a
ghastly one in the dull morning what was it now in all that
brilliant light

he had not moved he had been afraid to stir there had been a moan and
motion of the hand and with terror added to rage he had struck and
struck again once he threw a rug over it but it was worse to fancy
the eyes and imagine them moving towards him than to see them glaring
upward as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered
and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling he had plucked it off again
and there was the body mere flesh and blood no more but such flesh
and so much blood

he struck a light kindled a fire and thrust the club into it there
was hair upon the end which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder
and caught by the air whirled up the chimney even that frightened
him sturdy a she was but he held the weapon till it broke and then
piled it on the coals to burn away and smoulder into ashes he washed
himself and rubbed his clothes there were spots that would not be
removed but he cut the pieces out and burnt them how those stains
were dispersed about the room the very feet of the dog were bloody

all this time he had never once turned his backup on the corpse no
not for a moment such preparations completed he moved backward
towards the door dragging the dog with him les the should soil his
feet a new and carryout new evidence of the crime into the street she
shut the door softly locked it took the key and left the house

he crossed over and glanced up at the window to be sure that nothing
was visible from the outside there was the curtain still drawn which
she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again it lay
nearly under there he knew that god how the sun poured down upon
the very spot

the glance was instantaneous it was a relief to have got free of the
room he whistled on the dog and walked rapidly away

he went through islington strode up the hill at highgate on which
stands the stone in honour of whittington turned down to highgate
hill unsteady of purpose and uncertain where to go struck off to the
right again almost as soon a she began to descend it and taking the
footpath across the fields skirted caen wood and so came on
hampstead heath traversing the hollow by the vale of heath he mounted
the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the villages of
hampstead and highgate made along the remaining portion of the heath
to the fields at north end in one of which he laid himself downunder
a hedge and slept

soon he was up again and away not far into the country but back
towards london by the high road then back again then over another part
of the same ground a she already traversed then wandering up and down
in fields and lying on ditches brink store stand starting up to
make for some other spot and do the same and ramble on again

where could he go that was near and not too public to get some meat
and drink hendon that was a good place not far off and out of most
peoples way thither he directed his steps running sometimes and
sometimes with a strange perversity loitering at as nail space or
stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick but when
he got there all the people hemet the very children at the
doors seemed to view him with suspicion back he turned again without
the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no food for
many hours and once more he lingered on the heath uncertain where to
go

he wandered over miles and miles of ground and still came back to the
old place morning and noon had passed and the day was on the wane
and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round
and still lingered about the same spot atlas the got away and shaped
his course for hatfield

it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the
dog limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the
hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little
street crept into a small public house whose scanty light had guided
them to the spot there was a fire in the taproom and some
country labourers were drinking before it

they made room for the stranger but he sat down in the furthest
corner an date and drank alone or rather with his dog to whom he
cast a morsel of food from time to time

the conversation of the men assembled he returned upon the
neighbouring land and farmers and when those topics were exhausted
upon the age of some oldman who had been buried on the previous
sunday the young men present considering him very old and the old men
present declaring him to have been quite young not older one
white haired grandfather said than he was with tenor fifteen year of
life in him atleast if he had taken care if he had taken care

there was nothing to attract attention or excite alarm in this the
robber after paying his reckoning sat silent and unnoticed in his
corner and had almost dropped asleep when he was half wakened by the
noisy entrance of a newcomer

this was an antic fellow half pedlar and half mount e bank who
travelled about the country on foot to vend hones strop s razors
wash balls harness paste medicine for dogs and horses cheap
perfumery cosmetics and such like wares which he carried in a case
slung to his back his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes
with the countrymen which slackened not until he had made his supper
and opened his box of treasures when he ingeniously contrived to unite
business with amusement

and what be thats to of good to eat harry asked a grinning
countryman pointing to some composition cakes in one corner

this said the fellow producing one this is the infallible and
invaluable composition for removing allsorts of stain rust dirt
mildews picks peck spot or spatter from silk satin linen
cambric cloth crape stuff carpet merino muslin bomba zeen or
woollen stuff wine stains fruit stains beer stains water stains
paint stains pitch stains any stains all come out at one rub with
the infallible and invaluable composition if a lady stains her honour
she has only need to swallow one cake and shes cured at once for its
poison if a gentleman wants to prove this he has only need to bolt
one little square and he has put it beyond question for its quite as
satisfactory as a pistol bullet and a great deal nastier in the
flavour consequently the more credit in taking it one penny a square
with all these virtues one penny a square

there were two buyers directly and more of the listeners plainly
hesitated the vendor observing this increased in lo qua city

its all bought up as fast as it can be made said the fellow there
are fourteen water mills six steam engines and a galvanic battery
always a working upon it and they cant make it fast enough though
the men work so hard that they die off and the widows is pensioned
directly with twenty pound a year for each of the children and a
premium of fifty for twins one penny a square two halfpence is all
the same and four farthings is received with joy one penny a square
wine stains fruit stains beer stains water stains paint stains
pitch stains mud stains bloodstains here is a stain upon the hat of
a gentleman in company that ill take cleanout before he can order
meap into fale

hah cried sikes starting up give that back

ill take it cleanout sir replied the man winking to the company
before you can come across the room to get it gentlemen all observe
the dark stain upon this gentlemans hat no wider than a shilling but
thicker than a half crown whether it is a wine stain fruit stain
beer stain water stain paint stain pitch stain mud stain or
bloodstain

the man got no further for sikes with a hideous im pre cation overthrew
the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house

with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened
upon him despite himself all day the murderer finding that he was
not followed and that they most probably considered him some drunken
sullen fellow turned backup the town and getting out of the glare of
the lamps of a stagecoach that was standing in the street was walking
past when he recognised the mail from london and saw that it was
standing at the little post office he almost knew what was to come
but he crossed over and listened

the guard was standing at the door waiting for the letter bag a man
dressed like a gamekeeper came up at the moment and he handed him a
basket which lay ready on the pavement

thats for your people said the guard now look alive in there
will you damn that ere bag it war nt ready night afore last this
wont do you know

anything new up in town ben asked the gamekeeper drawing back to
the window shutters the better to admire the horses

no nothing that i knows on replied the man pulling on his gloves
corn supa little i he erd talk of a murder too down spitalfields
way but i dont reckon much upon it

oh thats quite true said a gentleman inside who was looking out
of the window and a dreadful murder it was

was it sir rejoined the guard touching his hat manor woman
pray sir

a woman replied the gentleman it is supposed

now ben replied the coachman impatiently

damn that ere bag said the guard are you gone to sleep in there

coming cried the office keeper running out

coming growled the guard a hands os the young oo man of property
thats going to take a fancy to me but i dont know when here give
holdall r iight

the horn sounded a few cheerful notes and the coach was gone

sikes remained standing in the street apparently unmoved by what he
had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where
to goat length he went back again and took the road which leads from
hatfield to st albans

he went on doggedly but a she left the town behind him and plunged
into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt ad read and a we
creeping upon him which shook him to the core every object before him
substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some
fearful thing but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that
haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following a this heels he
could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the
outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along he
could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of
wind came laden with that last low cry if he stopped it did the same
if her an it followed not running too that would have been a relief
but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life and borne on
one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell

at time she turned with desperate determination resolved to beat
this phantom off though it should look him dead but the hair rose on
his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was
behind him then he had kept it before him that morning but it was
behind now always he leaned his back against a bank and felt that it
stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky he threw
himself upon the road on his backup on the road a this head it stood
silent erect and still a living gravestone with its epitaph in
blood

let no man talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence
must sleep there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long
minute of that agony of fear

there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the
night before the door were three tall poplar trees which made it
very dark within and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail
he could not walk on till daylight came again and here he stretched
himself close to the wall to undergo new torture

for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than
that from which he had escaped those widely staring eyes so
lustre less and so glassy that he had better borne to see them than
think upon them appeared in the midst of the darkness light in
themselves but giving light to nothing there were but two but they
were everywhere if he shutout the sight there came the room with
every well known object some indeed that he would have forgotten if
he had gone over its contents from memory each in its accustomed place
the body was in its place and its eyes were a she saw them when he
stole away he got up and rushed into the field without the figure
was behind him here entered the shed and shrunk down once more the
eyes were there before he had laid himself along

and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling
in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when
suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting
and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder any sound of men in
that lonely place eventhough it conveyed a real cause of alarm was
something to him here gained his strength and energy at the prospect
of personal danger and springing to his feet rushed into the open
air

the broad sky seemed on fire rising into the air with showers of
sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting
the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the
direction where he stood the shouts grew louder as new voices swelled
the roar and he could hear the cry of fire mingled with the ringing
of an alarm bell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames
as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though
refreshed by food the noise increased a she looked there were people
there men and women light bustle it was like new life to him he
darted onward straight headlong dashing through brier and brake and
leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog who career ed with loud and
sounding bark before him

he came upon the spot there were half dressed figures tearing to and
fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables
others driving the cattle from the yard and outhouses and others
coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks
and the tumbling down of redhot beams the apertures where doors and
windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging firewalls
rocked and crumbled into the burning well the molten lead and iron
poured down white hot upon the ground women and children shrieked
and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers the
clanking of the engine pumps and the spirt ing and hissing of the water
as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar he
shouted too till he was hoarse and flying from memory and himself
plunged into the thickest of the throng hither and thither he dived
that night now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the
smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
men were thickest up and down the ladders upon the roofs of
buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under
the lee of falling brick sandstones in every part of that great fire
was he but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise
nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke
and blackened ruins remained

this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the
dreadful consciousness of his crime he looked suspiciously about him
for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject
of their talk the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and
they drew off stealthily together he passed near an engine where
some men were seated and they called to him to share in their
refreshment he took some bread and meat and a she drank a draught of
beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the
murder he has gone to birmingham they say said one but theyll
have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night there ll
be a cry all through the country

he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground then
laydown in a lane and had along but broken and uneasy sleep he
wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the
fear of another solitary night

suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london

theres somebody to speak to there at all even the thought a good
hiding place too theyll never expect to nab me thereafter this
country scent why cantil ie by for a week or so and forcing blunt
from fagin get abroad to france damme ill risk it

he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least
frequented roads began his journey back resolved to lie concealed
within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by
a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
fixed on for his destination

the dog though if any description of him were out it would not be
forgotten that the dog was missing and had probably gone with him
this might lead to his apprehension a she passed along the street she
resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond picking
up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief a she went

the animal looked up into his masters face while these preparations
were making whether his instinct apprehended something of their
purpose or the robbers side long look at him was sterner than
ordinary he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual and
cowered a she came more slowly along when his master halted at the
brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright

do you hear me call come here cried sikes

the animal came up from the very force of habit but as sikes stooped
to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and
started back

comeback said the robber

the dog wagged his tail but moved not sikes made a running noose and
called him again

the dog advanced retreated paused an instant and scoured away a this
hardest speed

the man whistled again and again and sat down and waited in the
expectation that he would return but no dog appeared and at length he
resumed his journey




chapter xlix
monks and mrbrown low at length meet their conversation and the
intelligence that interrupts it


the twilight was beginning to close in when mrbrown low alighted from
a hackney coach a this own door and knocked softly the door being
opened a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one
side of the steps while another man who had been seated on the box
dismounted too and stood upon the other side at a sign from mr
brownlow they helped out a third man and taking him between them
hurried him into the house this man was monks

they walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking and mr
brownlow preceding them led the way into a backroom at the door of
this apartment monks who had ascended with evident reluctance
stopped the t women looked at the old gentleman as if for
instructions

he knows the alternative said mr brow low if he hesitates or moves
a finger but as you bid him drag him into the street call for the aid
of the police and impeach him as a felon in my name

how dare you say this of me asked monks

how dare you urge me to it youngman replied mrbrown low
confronting him with a steady look are you mad enough to leave this
house unh and him there sir you are free to go and we to follow
but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that instant
will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery i am
resolute and immoveable if you are determined to be the same your
blood be upon your own head

by what authority am i kidnapped in the street and brought hereby
these dogs asked monks looking from one to the other of the men who
stood beside him

by mine replied mrbrown low those persons are indemnified by me
if you complain of being deprived of your liberty you had power and
opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it
advisable to remain quiet i say again throw yourself for protection on
the law i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far
to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have
passed into other hands and do not say i plunged you down the gulf
into which you rushed yourself

monks was plainly disconcerted and alarmed besides he hesitated

you will decide quickly said mrbrown low with perfect firmness and
composure if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign
you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a
shudder foresee i can not control once more i say for you know the
way if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those
you have deeply injured seat yourself without a word in that chair
it has waited for you two whole days

monks muttered some unintelligible words but wavered still

you will be prompt said mrbrown low a word from me and the
alternative has gone forever

still the man hesitated

i have not the inclination to parley said mrbrown low and as i
advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right

is there demanded monks with a faltering tongue is there no middle
course

none

monks looked at the old gentleman with an anxious eye but reading in
his countenance nothing but severity and determination walked into the
room and shrugging his shoulders sat down

lock the door on the outside said mrbrown low to the attendants
and come when i ring

the men obeyed and the two were left alone together

this is pretty treatment sir said monks throwing down his hat and
cloak from my fathers oldest friend

it is because i was your fathers oldest friend youngman returned
mrbrown low it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy
years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and
kindred whore joined her god in youth and left me here a solitary
lonely man it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters s
deathbed when he was yet a boy on the morning that would but heaven
willed otherwise have made her my young wife it is because my seared
heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and
error still he died it is because old recollections and associations
filled my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts
of him it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you
gently now yes edward lee ford even now and blush for your
unworthiness who bear the name

what has the name to do with it asked the other after
contemplating half in silence and half in dogged wonder the
agitation of his companion what is the name to me

nothing replied mrbrown low nothing to you but it washers
and even at this distance of time brings back to mean oldman the
glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a
stranger i am very glad you have changed it very very

this is all mighty fine said monks to retain his assumed
designation after along silence during which he had jerked himself
in sullen defiance to and fro and mrbrown low had sat shading his
face with his hand but what do you want with me

you have a brother said mrbrown low rousing himself a brother
the whisper of whose name in you rear when i came behind you in the
street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither
in wonder and alarm

i have no brother replied monks you know i was an only child why
do you talk to me of brothers you know that as well as i

attend to what i do know and you may not said mrbrown low i
shall interest you by and by i know that of the wretched marriage
into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all
ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole
and most unnatural issue

i dont care for hard names interrupted monks with a jeering laugh
you know the fact and thats enough for me

but i also know pursued the old gentleman the misery the slow
torture the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union i know how
listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their
heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how
cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave
place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last
they wrenched the clanking bond as under and retiring a wide space
apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death
could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest
looks they could assume your mother succeeded she forgot it soon but
i trusted and canker ed at your fathers heart for years

well they were separated said monks and what of that

when they had been separated for sometime returned mrbrown low
and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had
utterly forgotten the younghusband ten good years her junior who
with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new
friends this circumstance atleast you know already

not i said monks turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon
the ground as a man who is determined to deny everything not i

your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never
forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness returned mr
brownlow is peak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than
eleven years old and your father but one and thirty for he was i
repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry must i go back
to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will
you spare it and disclose to me the truth

i have nothing to disclose rejoined monks you must talk on if you
will

these new friends then said mrbrown low were a naval officer
retired from active service whose wife had died some half a year
before and left him with two children there had been more but of all
their family happily but two survived they were both daughters one a
beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or
three years old

whats this to me asked monks

they resided said mrbrown low without seeming to hear the
interruption in apart of the country to which your father in his
wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode
acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your
father was gifted as few men are he had his sisters soul and person
as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him i would
that it had ended there his daughter did the same

the old gentleman paused monks was biting his lips with his eyes
fixed upon the floor seeing this he immediately resumed

the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that
daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a
guileless girl

your tale is of the longest observed monks moving restlessly in his
chair

it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow youngman returned
mrbrown low and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed
joy and happiness it would be very brief at length one of those rich
relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had
been sacrificed as others are often it is no uncommon case died and
to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him
his panacea for all griefs money it was necessary that he should
immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and
where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion he went was
seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the
intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he
died the day after her arrival leaving no will no will so that the
whole property fell to her and you

at this part of the recital monks held his breath and listened with a
face of intense eagerness though his eyes were not directed towards
the speaker as mrbrown low paused he changed his position with the
air of one who has experienced a sudden relief and wiped his hot face
and hands

before he went abroad and a she passed through london on his way
said mrbrown low slowly and fixing his eyes upon the others face
he came to me

in ever heard of that interrupted monks in at one intended to appear
incredulous but savouring more of disagreeable surprise

he came to me and left with me among some other things a picture a
portrait painted by himself a likeness of this poor girl which he did
not wish to leave behind and could not carryforward on his hasty
journey he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked
in a wild distracted way of ruin and dishonour worked by himself
confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any
loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of
his recent acquisition to fly the country i guessed too well he would
not fly alone and never see it more even from me his old and early
friend whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that
covered one most dear to both even from me he withheld anymore
particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after
that to see me once again for the last time on earth alas that was
the last time i had no letter and in ever saw him more

i went said mrbrown low after a short pause i went when all was
over to the scene of his i will use the term the world would freely
use for worldly harshness or favour are now a like to him of his guilty
love resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should
find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her the family
had left that part a week before they had called in such trifling
debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the place by
night why or whither none can tell

monks drew his breath yet more freely and looked round with a smile of
triumph

when your brother said mrbrown low drawing nearer to the others
chair when your brother a feeble ragged neglected child was cast
in my way by a stronger hand than chance and rescued by me from a life
of vice and infamy

what cried monks

by me said mrbrown low it old you i should interest you before
long i say by me i see that your cunning associate suppressed my name
although for aug h the knew it would be quite strange to your ears
when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my
house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck
me with astonishment even when i first saw him in all his dirt and
misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me
like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream i
need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history

why not asked monks hastily

because you know it well

i

denial to me is vain replied mrbrown low i shall show you that i
know more than that

you you cant prove anything against me stammered monk side fy you
to do it

we shall see returned the old gentleman with a searching glance i
lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him your mother
being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody
could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate
in the west indies whither as you well know you retired upon your
mothers death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here i
made the voyage you had left it months before and were supposed to
be in london but no one could tell where i returned your agents had
no clue to your residence you came and went they said as strangely
as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for
months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with
the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce
ungovernable boy i wearied them with new applications i paced the
streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were
fruitless and in ever saw you for an instant

and now you do see me said monks rising boldly what then fraud
and robbery are high sounding words justified you think by a fancied
resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a deadman s brother
you dont even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you
dont even know that

i did not replied mrbrown low rising too but within the last
fortnight i have learnt it all you have a brother you know it and
him there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret
and the gain to you at her own death it contained a reference to some
child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was
born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were
first awakened by his resemblance to your father you repaired to the
place of his birth there existed proofs proofs long suppressed of his
birth and parentage those proofs were destroyed by you and now in
your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the
boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that
received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son
coward liar you who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in
darkroom sat night you whose plots and wiles have brought a violent
death upon the head of one worth millions such as you you who from
your cradle were galland bitterness to your own fathers heart and in
whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found
avent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to
your mind you edward lee ford do you still brave me

no no no returned the coward overwhelmed by these accumulated
charges

every word cried the gentleman every word that has passed between
you and this detested villain is known to me shadows on the wall have
caught your whispers and brought them tom year the sight of the
persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and
almost the attributes of virtue murder has been done to which you
were morally if not really a party

no no interposed monks ii knew nothing of that i was going to
inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me i didnt know the
cause i thought it was a common quarrel

it was the partial disclosure of your secrets replied mrbrown low
will you disclose the whole

yes i will

set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before
witnesses

that i promise too

remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed
with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose
of at testing it

if you insist upon that ill do that also replied monks

you must do more than that said mrbrown low make restitution to
an innocent and un offending child for such he is although the
offspring of a guilty and most miserable love you have not forgotten
the provisions of the will carry them into execution so far as your
brother is concerned and then go where you please in this world you
need meet no more

while monks was pacing up and down meditating with dark and evil looks
on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it torn by his fears
on the one hand and his hatred on the other the door was hurriedly
unlocked and a gentleman mr los berne entered the room in violent
agitation

the man will be taken he cried he will be taken tonight

the murderer asked mrbrown low

yes yes replied the other his dog has been seen lurking about
some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is
or will be there undercover of the darkness spies are hovering
about in every direction i have spoken to the men who are charged with
his capture and they tell me he can not escape a reward of a hundred
pounds is proclaimed by government tonight

i will give fifty more said mrbrown low and proclaim it with my
own lips upon the spot if i can reach it where is mr may lie

harry as soon a she had seen your friend here safe in a coach with
you he hurried off to where he heard this replied the doctor and
mounting his horses allied forth to join the first party at someplace
in the outskirts agreed upon between them

fagin said mrbrown low what of him

when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by
this time they re sure of him

have you made up your mind asked mrbrown low in a low voice of
monks

yes he replied you you will be secret with me

i will remain here till i return it is your only hope of safety

they left the room and the door was again locked

what have you done asked the doctor in a whisper

all that i could hope to do and even more coupling the poor girls
intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good
friends inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and
laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day
write and appoint the evening after tomorrow at seven for the
meeting we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require
rest especially the young lady who may have greater need of
firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now but my blood
boils to avenge this poor murdered creature which way have they
taken

drive straight to the office and you will be in time replied mr
los berne i will remain here

the two gentlemen hastily separated each in a fever of excitement
wholly uncontrollable




chapter l
the pursuit and escape


near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe
abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on
the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
close built low roofed houses there exists the filthiest the
strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are
hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of
its inhabitants

to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through amaze of
close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest
of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they maybe supposed to
occasion the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
shops the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
the salesman s door and stream from the house parapet and windows
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class
ball as the avers coal whippers brazen women ragged children and the
raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along
assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which
branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of
ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
of warehouses that rise from every corner arriving at length in
streets remoter and less frequented than those through which he has
passed he walks beneath tottering house fronts projecting over the
pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter a she passes chimneys
half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron
bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign
of desolation and neglect

in such a neighborhood beyond dock head in the borough of southwark
stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet
deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill
pond but known in the days of this story as folly ditch it is a creek
or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water by
opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took it sold name
at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden bridges
thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the houses
on either side lowering from their backdoors and windows buckets
pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the water up
and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses
themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before
him crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses
with holes from which to lookup on the slime beneath windows broken
and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is
never there rooms so small so filthy so confined that the air would
seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter
wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening
to fall into it as some have done dirt be smeared walls and decaying
foundations every repulsive lineament of poverty every loathsome
indication of filth rot and garbage all these ornament the banks of
folly ditch

in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty the walls are
crumbling down the windows are windows no more the doors are falling
into the streets the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke
thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon
it it was a thriving place but now it is a desolate island indeed
the houses have no owners they are broken open and entered upon by
those who have the courage and there they live and there they die
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced
to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island

in an upper room of one of these houses a detached house of fair size
ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window of
which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
described there were assembled three men who regarding each other
every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation
sat for sometime in profound and gloomy silence one of these was to by
crack it another mr chit ling and the third a robber of fifty years
whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and whose
face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same
occasion this man was a returned transport and his name was k ags

i wish said to by turning to mr chit ling that you had picked out
some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come
here my fine feller

why didnt you blunder head said k ags

well i thought you d have been a little more glad to see me than
this replied mr chit ling with a melancholy air

why look e young gentleman said to by when a man keeps himself so
very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over
his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it its rather a
startling thing to have the honour of aw is it from a young gentleman
however respectable and pleasant a person he maybe to play cards with
at con we ni ency circumstanced as you are

especially when the exclusive youngman has got a friend stopping
with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts
and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return
added mrk ags

there was a short silence after which to by crack it seeming to abandon
as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care
swagger turned to chit ling and said

when was fagin took then

just at dinnertime two oclock this afternoon charley and i made our
lucky up the wash us chimney and bolter got into the empty water butt
head downwards but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out
at the top and so they took him too

and bet

poor bet she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied
chit ling his countenance falling more and more and went off mad
screaming and raving and beating her head against the boards so they
put a strait we sku to n her and took her to the hospital and there she
is

wots come of young bates demanded k ags

he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here
soon replied chit ling there snow here else to goto now for the
people at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the ken i
went up there and see it with my own eyes is filled with traps

this is a smash observed to by biting his lips theres more than
one will go with this

the sessions are on said k ags if they get the inquest over and
bolter turns kings evidence as of course he will from what hes said
already they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and get the
trial on on friday and hell swingin six days from this by g

you should have heard the people groan said chit ling the officers
fought like devils or they d have torn him away he was down once but
they made arin ground him and fought their way along you should have
seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them
as if they were his dearest friends i can see em now notable to
stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along
amongst emi can see the people jumping up one behind another and
snarling with their teeth and making at him i can see the blood upon
his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked
themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore
they d tear his heart out

the horror stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his
ears and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro
like one distracted

while he was thus engaged and the two mens at by in silence with their
eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs
and sikes s dog bounded into the room they ran to the window
downstairs and into the street the dog had jumped in at an open
window he made no attempt to follow them nor was his master to be
seen

whats the meaning of this said to by when they had returned he
cant becoming here ii hope not

if he was coming here hed have come with the dog said k ags
stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor
here give us some water for him he has run himself faint

hes drunk it all up every drop said chit ling after watching the
dog sometime in silence covered with mud lame half blind he must
have come along way

where can he have come from exclaimed to by hes been to the other
kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here
where hes been many a time and often but where can he have come from
first and how comes he here alone without the other

he none of them called the murderer by his old name he cant have
made away with himself what do you think said chit ling

to by shook his head

if he had said k ags the do gud want to lead us away to where he
did it no i think hes got out of the country and left the dog
behind he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so
easy

this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the
right the dog creeping under a chair coiled himself up to sleep
without more notice from anybody

it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candlelight ed and
placed upon the table the terrible events of the last two days had
made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and
uncertainty of their own position they drew their chairs closer
together starting at every sound they spoke little and that in
whispers and were as silent and a we stricken as if the remains of the
murdered woman lay in the next room

they had sat thus sometime when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below

young bates said k ags looking angrily round to check the fear he
felt himself

the knocking came again no it was n the he never knocked like that

crack it went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head
there was no need to tell them who it was his paleface was enough
the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the
door

we must let him in he said taking up the candle

isnt there any help for it asked the other man in a hoarse voice

none he must come in

dont leave us in the dark said kag staking down a candle from the
chimney piece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he had finished

crack it went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the
lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief and another tied over
his head under his ha the drew them slowly off blanched face sunken
eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh short
thick breath it was the very ghost of sikes

he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room
but shuddering a she was about to drop into it and seeming to glance
over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wall as close as it
would go and ground it against it and sat down

not a word had been exchanged he looked from one to another in
silence if an eye were furtively raised and me this it was instantly
averted when his hollow voice broke silence they all three started
they seemed never to have heard it stones before

how came that dog here he asked

alone three hours ago

to nights paper says that fagin s took is it true oral ie

true

they were silent again

damn you all said sikes passing his hand across his forehead have
you nothing to say to me

there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke

you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crack it
do you mean to sell me or to let melie here till this hunt is over

you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person
addressed after some hesitation

sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him rather trying to
turn his head than actually doing it and said is it the body is it
buried

they shook their heads

why isnt i the retorted with the same glance behind him wot do
they keep such ugly things above the ground for whos that knocking

crack it intimated by a motion of his hand a she left the room that
there was nothing to fear and directly came back with charley bates
behind him sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy
entered the room he encountered his figure

to by said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards
him why didnt you tell me this downstairs

there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the
three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad
accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with
him

let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still
farther

charley said sikes stepping forward dont you dont you know me

dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and
looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face you
monster

the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other but sikes s
eyes sunk gradually to the ground

witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and
becoming more and more excited a she spoke witness you three im not
afraid of him if they come hereafter him ill give him up i will i
tell you out at once he may kill me for it if he likes or if he
dares but if i am here ill give him up id give him up if he was to
be boiled alive murder help if theres the pluck of a man among you
three youll help me murder help down with him

pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent
gest i culation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the
strongman and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of
his surprise brought him heavily to the ground

the three spectators seemed quite stupefied they offered no
interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together the
former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his
hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast
and never ceasing to call for help with all his might

the contest however was too unequal to last long sikes had him down
and his knee was on his throat when crack it pulled him back with a
look of alarm and pointed to the window there were lights gleaming
below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried
footsteps endless they seemed in number crossing the nearest wooden
bridge one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd for there
was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement the gleam of
lights increased the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on then
came aloud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from such a
multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail

help shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air hes here
breakdown the door

in the kings name cried the voices without and the hoarse cry
arose again but louder

breakdown the door screamed the boy i tell you theyll never open
it run straight to the room where the light is breakdown the door

strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower
window shutters a she ceased to speak and aloud huzzah burst from the
crowd giving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of
its immense extent

open the door of someplace where i can lock this screeching
hell babe cried sikes fiercely running to and fro and dragging the
boy no was easily as if he were an empty sack that door quick he
flung him in bolted it and turned the key is the downstairs door
fast

double locked and chained replied crack it who with the other two
men still remained quite helpless and bewildered

the panels are they strong

lined with sheet iron

and the windows too

yes and the windows

damn you cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd do your worst ill cheat you yet

of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could
exceed the cry of the infuriated throng some shouted to those who were
nearest to set the house on fire others roared to the officers to
shoot him dead among them all none showed such fury as the man on
horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting
through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the
window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the
man who brings a ladder

the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it some called
for ladders some for sledgehammers some ran with torches to and fro
as if to seek them and still came back and roared again some spent
their breath in impotent curses and execration s some pressed forward
with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of those
below some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the waterspout
and crevices in the wall and all waved to and fro in the darkness
beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind and joined from
time to time in one loud furious roar

the tide cried the murderer a she staggered back into the room and
shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up give me a rope a
long rope they re all in front i may drop into the folly ditch and
clear off that way give me a rope or i shall do three more murders
and kill myself

the panic stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept the
murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up
to the house top

all the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up
except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that
was too small even for the passage of his body but from this
aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the
back and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the house top by
the door in the roof aloud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
front who immediately began top our round pressing upon each other in
an unbroken stream

he planted aboard which he had carried up with him for the purpose
so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
to open it from the inside and creeping over the tiles looked over
the low parapet

the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud

the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his
motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it
and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
which all their previous shouting had been whispers again and again it
rose those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning took
up the sound it echoed and re echoed it seemed as though the whole
city had poured its population out to curse him

on pressed the people from the front on on on in a strong struggling
current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch to lighten
them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion the houses
on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mobs ashes
were thrown up or torn bodily out there were tiers and tiers of faces
in every window cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every
house top each little bridge and there were three insight bent
beneath the weight of the crowd upon it still the current poured on to
find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only for an
instant see the wretch

they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge hurrah

the crowd grew light with uncovered heads and again the shout up rose

i will give fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter to the man who takeshima live i will remain here till he
come to ask me for it

there was another roar at this moment the word was passed among the
crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first
called for the ladder had mounted into the room the stream abruptly
turned as this intelligencer an from mouth to mouth and the people at
the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their
stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now
thronged pell mell to the spot they had left each man crushing and
striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near
the door and lookup on the criminal as the officers brought him out
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation
or trampled down and trodden underfoot in the confusion were
dreadful the narrow ways were completely blocked up and at this time
between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and
the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the
mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer
although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible
increased

the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
crowd and the impossibility of escape but seeing this sudden change
with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his feet
determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the
ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in
the darkness and confusion

roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within
the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he
set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the
rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong
running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second he
could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the
ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut
it then and drop

at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to
slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman
before mentioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly
warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down at
that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw
his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror

the eyes again he cried in an unearthly screech

staggering as if struck by lightning he los this balance and tumbled
over the parapet the noose was on his neck it ran up with his weight
tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speed she fell for
five and thirty feet there was a sudden jerk a terrific convulsion of
the limbs and there he hung with the open knife clenched in his
stiffening hand

the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely the
murderer swung lifeless against the wall and the boy thrusting aside
the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come
and take him out for gods sake

a dog which had la in concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on
the parapet with a dismal howland collecting himself for a spring
jumped for the deadman s shoulders missing his aim he fell into the
ditch turning completely over a she went and striking his head
against a stone dashed out his brains




chapter li
affording an explanation of more mysteries than one and comprehending
a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pin money


the events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old when
oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a
travelling carriage rolling fast towards his native town mrs may lie
and rose and mrs bed win and the good doctor were with him and mr
brownlow followed in a post chaise accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned

they had not talked much upon the way for oliver was in aflutter of
agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less
effect on his companions who shared it in atleast an equal degree
he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr
brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
monks and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense

the same kind friend had with mr los berne s assistance cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long
but it might beat a better time than the present and it could not be
at a worse so they travelled on in silence each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together and no one
disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all

but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they
journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the
whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a
crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into
that which he had traversed on foot a poorhouse less wandering boy
without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head

see there there cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose
and pointing out at the carriage window thats the stile i came over
there are the hedges i crept behind for fear anyone should overtake
me and force me back yonder is the path across the fields leading to
the old house where i was a little child oh dick dick my dear old
friend if i could only see you now

you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands
between her own you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich
you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great
as the coming back to make him happy too

yes yes said oliver and well well take him away from here and
have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place
where he may grow strong and well shall we

rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak

you will be kind and good to him for you are to everyone said
oliver it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell but
nevermind nevermind it will be all over and you will smile again i
know that too to think how changed he is you did the same with me he
said god bless you to me when iran away cried the boy with a burst
of affectionate emotion and i will say god bless you now and show
him how i love him for it

as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow
streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
within reasonable bounds there was sower berrys the undertakers just
as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
remembered it there were all the well known shops and houses with
almost everyone of which he had some slight incident connected there
was gam fields cart the very car the used to have standing at the old
public house door there was the workhouse the dreary prison of his
youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the street there was
the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver
involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so
foolish then cried then laughed again there were scores of faces at
the doors and windows that he knew quite well there was nearly
everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life
had been but a happy dream

but it was pure earnest joyful reality they drove straight to the
door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with a we
and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
and size and here was mr grim wig allready to receive them kissing
the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as
if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness
and not offering to ea this head no not once not even when he
contradicted a very old post boy about the nearest road to london and
maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and
that time fast asleep there was dinner prepared and there were
bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic

notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first half hour was
over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their
journey down mrbrown low did not join them at dinner but remained in
a separate room the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with
anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present
conversed apart once mrs may lie was called away and after being
absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping all
these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets
nervous and uncomfortable they sat wondering in silence or if they
exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to
hear the sound of their own voices

at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they
were to hear no more that night mr los berne and mr grim wig entered
the room followed by mrbrown low andaman whom oliver almost
shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother
and it was the same man he had met at the market town and seen looking
in with fagin at the window of his little room monks cast a look of
hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy
and sat down near the door mrbrown low who had papers in his hand
walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated

this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have
been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance
repeated here i would have spared you the degradation but we must
hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why

go on said the person addressed turning away his face quick i
have almost done enough i think dont keep me here

this child said mrbrown low drawing oliver to him and laying his
hand upon his head is your half brother the illegitimate son of your
father my dear friend edwin lee ford by poor young agnes fleming who
died in giving him birth

yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy the beating of whose
hear the might have heard that is the bastard child

the term you use said mrbrown low sternly is a reproach to those
long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world it reflects
disgrace on no one living except you who use it let that pass he was
born in this town

in the workhouse of this town was the sullen reply you have the
story there he pointed impatiently to the papers a she spoke

i must have i there too said mrbrown low looking roundup on the
listeners

listen then you returned monks his father being taken ill at
rome was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long
separated who went from paris and took me with her to look after his
property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor
he for her he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he
slumbered on till next day when he died among the papers in his desk
were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to
yourself he addressed himself to mrbrown low and enclosed in a few
short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that
it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead one of these papers
was a letter to this girl agnes the other a will

what of the letter asked mrbrown low

the letter a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a
penitent confession and prayers to god to help her he had palmed a
tale on the girl that some secret mystery to be explained one
day prevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on
trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what
none could ever give her back she was at that time within a few
months of her confinement he told her all he had meant to do to hide
her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse
his memory or think the consequences of theirs in would be visited on
her or their young child for all the guilt was his he reminded her of
the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her
christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he
hope done day to have bestowed upon her prayed her yet to keep it and
wear it next her heart as she had done before and then ran on wildly
in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted i
believe he had

the will said mrbrown low as olivers tears fell fast

monks was silent

the will said mrbrown low speaking for him was in the same
spirit as the letter he talked of miseries which his wife had brought
upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature
bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and
left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds the
bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions one for agnes
fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and
ever come of age if it were a girl it was to inherit the money
unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his
minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of
dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong he did this he said to mark
his confidence in the mother and his conviction only strengthened by
approaching death that the child would share her gentle heart and
noble nature if he were disappointed in this expectation then the
money was to come to you for then and not till then when both
children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his
purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed
him with coldness and a version

my mother said monks in a louder tone did what a woman should
have done she burnt this will the letter never reached its
destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever
tried to lie away the blot the girls father had the truth from her
with every aggravation that her violent hate i love her for it
now could add goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children
into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends
might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards
he was found dead in his bed the girl had left her home in secret
some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and
village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that
she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old
heart broke

there was a short silence here until mrbrown low took up the thread
of the narrative

years after this he said this mans edward lee ford smother came
to me he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and
money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two
years he had associated with the lowest outcasts she was sinking under
a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she
died inquiries were set on foot and strict searches made they were
unavailing for along time but ultimately successful and he went back
with her to france

there she died said monks after a lingering illness and on her
deathbed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her
unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she
need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she
would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child
too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been
born and was alive is wore to her if ever it crossed my path to
hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and
most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply
felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by
dragging it if i could to the very gallows foot she was right he
came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i
would have finished as i began

as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on
himself in the impotence of baffled malice mrbrown low turned to the
terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been
his old accomplice and confidant had a large reward for keeping oliver
ensnared of which some part was to be given up in the event of his
being rescued and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit
to the country house for the purpose of identifying him

the locket and ring said mrbrown low turning to monks

i bought them from the man and woman it old you of who stole them
from the nurse who stole them from the corpse answered monks without
raising his eyes you know what became of them

mrbrown low merely nodded to mr grim wig who disappearing with great
alacrity shortly returned pushing in mrs bumble and dragging her
unwilling consort after him

do my his deceive me cried mr bumble with ill feigned enthusiasm
or is that little oliver oh oliver if you know d how ive been
a grieving for you

hold your tongue fool murmured mrs bumble

isnt natur natur mrs bumble remonstrated the work housemaster
c anti be supposed to feel i as brought him up p orochi ally when i
see him a setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affable st
description i always loved that boy as if hed been my my my own
grandfather said mr bumble halting for an appropriate comparison
master oliver my dear you remember the blessed gentleman in the
white waistcoat ah he went to heaven last week in a oak coffin with
plated handles oliver

come sir said mr grim wig tartly suppress your feelings

i will do my endeavours sir replied mr bumble how do you do
siri hope you are very well

this salutation was addressed to mrbrown low who had stepped up to
within a short distance of the respectable couple he inquired a she
pointed to monks

do you know that person

no replied mrs bumble flatly

perhaps you dont said mrbrown low addressing her spouse

in ever saw him in all my life said mr bumble

nor sold him anything perhaps

no replied mrs bumble

you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring said mr
brownlow

certainly not replied the matron why are we brought here to answer
to such nonsense as this

again mrbrown low nodded to mr grim wigand again that gentleman
limped away with extraordinary readiness but not again did he return
with a stout man and wife for this time he led in two palsied women
who shook and tottered as they walked

you shut the door the night old sally died said the foremost one
raising her shrivelled hand but you couldnt shutout the sound nor
stop the chinks

no no said the other looking round her and wagging her toothless
jaws no no no

we heard her try to tell you what shed done and saw you take a paper
from her hand and watched you too next day to the pawnbrokers
shop said the first

yes added the second and it was a locket and goldring we found
out that and saw it given you we were by oh we were by

and we know more than that resumed the first for she told us
often long ago that the young mother had told her that feelings he
should never get over it she was on her way at the time that she was
taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child

would you like to see the pawnbroker himself asked mr grim wig with
a motion towards the door

no replied the woman if he she pointed to monks has been coward
enough to confess as i see he has and you have sounded all these hags
till you have found the right ones i have nothing more to say i did
sell them and they re where youll never get them what then

nothing replied mrbrown low except that it remains for us to take
care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again you
may leave the room

i hope said mr bumble looking about him with great rue fulness as
mr grim wig disappeared with the two old women i hope that this
unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my p orochi al
office

indeed it will replied mrbrown low you may makeup your mind to
that and think yourself well off besides

it was all mrs bumble she would do it urged mr bumble first
looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room

that is no excuse replied mrbrown low you were present on the
occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more
guilty of the two in the eye of the law for the law supposes that
your wife acts under your direction

if the law supposes that said mr bumble squeezing his hat
emphatically in both hands the law is a ass a idiot if thats the
eye of the law the law is a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is
that his eye maybe opened by experience by experience

laying great stress on the repetition of these two words mr bumble
fixed his hat on very tight and putting his hands in his pockets
followed his helpmate downstairs

young lady said mrbrown low turning to rose give me your hand
do not tremble you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we
have to say

if they have i do not know how they can but if they have any
reference to me said rose pray let me hear them at some other time
i have not strength or spirits now

nay returned the old gent l man drawing her arm through his you
have more fortitude than this i am sure do you know this young lady
sir

yes replied monks

in ever saw you before said rose faintly

i have seen you often returned monks

the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said mr
brownlow what was the fate of the other the child

the child replied monks when her father died in a strange place
in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that
yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be
traced the child was taken by some wretched cottagers who rear edit as
their own

go on said mrbrown low signing to mrs may lie to approach go
on

you couldnt find the spot to which these people had repaired said
monks but where friendship fails hatred will often force away my
mother found it after a year of cunning search ay and found the
child

she took it did she

no the people were poor and began to sicken atleast the man did of
their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small
present of money which would not last long and promised more which
she never meant to send she didnt quite rely however on their
discontent and poverty for the childs unhappiness but told the
history of the sisters shame with such alterations as suited her
bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and
told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or
other the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it
and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to
satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the
girl by chance pitied her and took her home there was some cursed
spell i think against us for inspite of all our efforts she
remained there and was happy i lost sight of her two or three years
ago and saw her no more until a few months back

do you see her now

yes leaning on your arm

but not the less my niece cried mrs may lie folding the fainting
girl in her arms not the less my dearest child i would not lose her
now for all the treasures of the world my sweet companion my own
dear girl

the only friend i ever had cried rose clinging to her the
kindest best of friends my heart will burst i can not bear all this

you have borne more and have been through all the best and gentlest
creature that evershed happiness on everyone she knew said mrs
may lie embracing her tenderly come come my love remember who this
is who waits to clasp you in his arms poor child see here look look
my dear

not aunt cried oliver throwing his arms about her nec kill never
call her aunt sister my own dear sister that something taught my
heart to love so dearly from the first rose dear darling rose

let the tears which fell and the broken words which were exchanged in
the long close embrace between the orphans be sacred a father
sister and mother were gained and lost in that one moment joy and
grief were mingled in the cup but there were no bitter tears for even
grief itself arose so softened and clothed in such sweet and tender
recollections that it became a solemn pleasure and lost all character
of pain

they were along longtime alone a soft tap at the door at length
announced that someone was without oliver opened it glided away and
gave place to harry may lie

i knowitall he said taking a seat beside the lovely girl dear
rose i knowitall

i am not hereby accident he added after a lengthened silence nor
have i heard all this tonight for i knew it yesterday only yesterday
do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise

stay said rose you do know all

all you gave me leave at anytime within a year to renew the
subject of our last discourse

i did

not to press you to alter your determination pursued the youngman
but to hear you repeat it if you would i was to lay whatever of
station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still
adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or
act to seek to change it

the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now
said rose firmly if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose
goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i
ever feel it as i should tonight it is a struggle said rose but
one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear

the disclosure of tonight harry began

the disclosure of tonight replied rose softly leaves me in the
same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before

you harden your heart against me rose urged her lover

oh harry harry said the young lady bursting into tears i wish i
could and spare myself this pain

then why inflict it on yourself said harry taking her hand think
dear rose think what you have heard tonight

and what have i heard what have i heard cried rose that a sense
of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned
all there we have said enough harry we have said enough

not yet not yet said the youngman detaining her as she rose my
hopes my wishes prospects feeling every thought in life except my
love for you have undergone a change ioffer you now no distinction
among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and
detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but
real disgrace and shame but a home a heart and home yes dearest rose
and those and those alone are all i have to offer

what do you means he faltered

i mean but this that when i left you last i left you with a firm
determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me
resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine
that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn
from it this i have done those who have shrunk from me because of
this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right such power and
patronage such relatives of influence and rank as smiled upon me
then look coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in
englands richest county and by one village church mine rose my
own there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of
than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold this is
my rank and station now and here i lay it down


its a trying thing waiting supper for lovers said mr grim wig
waking up and pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head

truth to tell the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time
neither mrs may lien or harry nor rose who all came in together
could offer a word in extenuation

i had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight said mr grim wig
for i began to think i should get nothing else ill take the liberty
if youll allow me of saluting the bride that is to be

mr grim wig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the
blushing girl and the example being contagious was followed both by
the doctor and mrbrown low some people affirm that harry may lie had
been observed to set it originally in a darkroom adjoining but the
best authorities consider this downright scandal he being young and a
clergyman

oliver my child said mrs may lie where have you been and why do
you look so sad there are tears stealing down your face at this
moment what is the matter

it is a world of disappointment often to the hopes we most cherish
and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour

poor dick was dead




chapter lii
fagin s last night alive


the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space from the rail before
the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries all looks were fixed upon one man fagin before him and
behind above below on the right and on the left he seemed to stand
surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes

he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand
resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and
his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater
distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was
delivering his charge to the jury at time she turned his eyes sharply
upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his
favour and when the points against him were stated with terrible
distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that he would
even then urge something in his behalf beyond these manifestations of
anxiety he stirred not hand or foo the had scarcely moved since the
trial began and now that the judge ceased to speak he still remained
in the same strained attitude of close attention with his gaze benton
him as though he listened still

as light bustle in the court recalled him to himself looking round
he saw that the jury men had turned together to consider their verdict
as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising
above each other to see his face some hastily applying their glasses
to their eyes and others whispering their neighbours with looks
expressive of abhorrence a few there were who seemed unmindful of
him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could
delay but in no one face not even among the women of whom there were
many there could he read the faintest sympathy with himself or any
feeling but one of all absorbing interest that he should be condemned

ashes a wall this in one bewildered glance the death like stillness
came again and looking back he saw that the jury men had turned towards
the judge hush

they only sought permission to retire

he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed
out as though to see which way the greater number leant but that was
fruitless the jailer touched him on the shoulder he followed
mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair the man
pointed it out or he would not have seen it

he looked up into the gallery again some of the people were eating
and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs for the crowded place
was very hot there was one youngman sketching his face in a little
notebook he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the
artist broke his pencil point and made another with his knife as any
idle spectator might have done

in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind
began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost
and how he put it on there was an old fat gentleman on the bench too
who had gone out some half an hour before and now comeback he
wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner
what he had had and where he had had it and pursued this train of
careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused
another

not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one
oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened a this feet it
was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could
not fix his thoughts upon it thus even while he trembled and turned
burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting their on
spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken
off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was then he
thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold and stopped
to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it and then went on to
think again

at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all
towards the door the jury returned and passed him close he could
glean nothing from their faces they might as well have been of stone
perfect stillness ensued not a rustle not a breath guilty

the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another
and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled
out like angry thunder it was a peal of joy from the populace
outside greeting the news that he would die on monday

the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him he had resumed his
listening attitude and looked intently a this questioner while the
demand was made but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it
and then he only muttered that he was an oldman an oldman and so
dropping into a whisper was silent again

the judge assumed the blackcap and the prisoner still stood with the
same air and gesture a woman in the gallery uttered some exclamation
called forth by this dread solemnity he looked hastily up as if angry
at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively the address
was solemn and impressive the sentence fearful to hear but he stood
like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve his haggard face
was still thrust forward his under jaw hanging down and his eyes
staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his armand
beckoned him away he gazed stupidly about him for an instant and
obeyed

they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners
were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their
friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard
there was nobodythere to speak to him but a she passed the
prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were
clinging to the bars and they assailed him with opprobrious names and
screeched and hissed he shook his fist and would have spat upon them
but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage lighted by
a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison

here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of
anticipating the law this ceremony performed they led him to one of
the condemned cells and left him there alone

he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat
and bedstead and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to
collect his thoughts after a while he began to remember a few
disjointed fragments of what the judge had said though it had seemed
to him at the time that he could not hear a word these gradually
fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more so that
in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered to be
hanged by the neck till he was dead that was the end to be hanged by
the neck till he was dead

as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known
who had died upon the scaffold some of them through his means they
rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them he
had seen some of them die and had joked too because they died with
prayers upon their lips with what a rattling noise the drop went down
and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to dangling
heaps of clothes

some of them might have inhabited that very cells at upon that very
spot it was very dark why didnt they bring a light the cell had
been built for many years scores of men must have passed their last
hours there it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies the
cap the noose the pinioned arms the faces that he knew even beneath
that hideous veil light light

at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door
and wall st women appeared one bearing a candle which he thrust into
an iron candlestick fixed against the wall the other dragging in a
mattress on which to pass the night for the prisoner was to be left
alone no more

then came the night dark dismal silentnight other watchers are glad
to hear this church clock strike for they tell of life and coming day
to him they brought despair the boom of every iron bell came laden
with the one deep hollow sound death what availed the noise and
bustle of cheerful morning which penetrated even there to him it was
another form of knell with mockery added to the warning

the day passed off day there was no day it was gone as soon as
come and night came on again night so long and yet so short long in
its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours at one time he
raved and blasphemed and at another howled and to re his hair
venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he
had driven them away with curses they renewed their charitable
efforts and he beat them off

saturday night he had only one night more to live and a she thought
of this the day broke sunday

it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering
sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon
his blighted soul not that he had ever held any defined or positive
hope of mercy but that he had never be enable to consider more than
the dim probability of dying so soon he had spoken little to either of
the t women who relieved each other in their attendance upon him and
they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention he had
sat there awake but dreaming now he started up every minute and
with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they used to such sights recoiled
from him with horror he grew so terrible at last in all the tortures
of his evil conscience that one man could not bear to sit there
eyeing him alone and so the two kept watch together

he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the pas the had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth his redhair
hung down upon his bloodless face his beard was torn and twisted into
knots his eyes shone with a terrible light his unwashed flesh
crackled with the fever that burnt him up eight nine then if it was
not a trick to frighten him and those were the real hours treading on
each others heels where would he be when they came round again
eleven another struck before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate at eight he would be the only mourner in his own
funeral train at eleven

those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and
such unspeakable anguish not only from the eyes but too often and
too long from the thoughts of men never held so dread a spectacle as
that the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the man
was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow would have slept but ill that
night if they could have seen him

from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two
and three presented themselves at the lodge gate and inquired with
anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received these being
answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to
clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from
which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built
and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the
scene by degrees they fell off one by one and for an hour in the
dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness

the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers
painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd when mrbrown low and oliver appeared
at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner
signed by one of the sheriffs they were immediately admitted into the
lodge

is the young gentleman to come too sir said the man whose duty it
was to conduct them its not a sight for children sir

it is not indeed my friend rejoined mrbrown low but my business
with this man is intimately connected with him and as this child has
seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as
well even at the cost of some pain and fear that he should see him
now

these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver
the man touched his hat and glancing at oliver with some curiousity
opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and
led the mon through dark and winding ways towards the cells

this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
workmen were making some preparations in profound silence this is the
place he passes through if you step this way you can see the door he
goes out at

he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the
prison food and pointed to a door there was an open grating above it
through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the noise of
hammering and the throwing down of boards they were putting up the
scaffold

from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by
other turn keys from the inner side and having entered an open yard
ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row
of strong doors on the lefthand motioning them to remain where they
were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys the
two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage
stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned
the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell they did so

the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side
to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
face of a man his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for he
continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence
otherwise than as apart of his vision

good boy charley well done he mumbled oliver too hahaha
oliver too quite the gentleman now quite the take that boy away to
bed

the jailer took the disengaged hand of oliver and whispering him not
to be alarmed looked on without speaking

take him away to bed cried fagin do you hear me some of you he
has been the the somehow the cause of all this its worth the money to
bring him up to it bolters throat bill nevermind the girl bolters
throat as deep as you can cut saw his head off

fagin said the jailer

that sme cried the jew falling instantly into the attitude of
listening he had assumed upon his trial an oldman my lord a very
old oldman

here said the turnkey laying his hand upon his breast to keep him
down heres somebody wants to see you to ask you some questions i
suppose fagin fagin are you a man

is hant be one long he replied looking up with a face retaining no
human expression but rage and terror strike them all dead what right
have they to butcher me

a she spoke he caught sight of oliver and mrbrown low shrinking to
the furthest corner of these a the demanded to know what they wanted
there

steady said the turnkey still holding him down now sir tell him
what you want quick if you please for he grows worse as the time
gets on

you have some papers said mrbrown low advancing which we replaced
in your hands for better security by a man called monks

its all a lie together replied fagin i havent one not one

for the love of god said mrbrown low solemnly do not say that
now upon the very verge of death but tell me where they are you know
that sikes is dead that monks has confessed that there is no hope of
any further gain where are those papers

oliver cried fagin beckoning to him here here let me whisper to
you

i am not afraid said oliver in a low voice a she relinquished mr
brown lows hand

the papers said fagin drawing oliver towards him are in a canvas
bag in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front room i
want to talk to you my dear i want to talk to you

yes yes returned oliver let me say a prayer do let me say one
prayer say only one upon your knees with me and we will talk till
morning

outside outside replied fagin pushing the boy before him towards
the door and looking vacantly over his head say ive gone to
sleep theyll believe you you can get me out if you take me so now
then now then

oh god forgive this wretched man cried the boy with a burst of
tears

thats right thats right said fagin that ll help us on this
door first if i shake and tremble as we pass the gallows dont you
mind but hurry on now now now

have you nothing else to ask him sir inquired the turnkey

no other question replied mrbrown low if i hoped we could recall
him to a sense of his position

nothing will do that sir replied the man shaking his head you
had better leave him

the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned

press on press on cried fagin softly but not so slow faster
faster

the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp
held him back he struggled with the power of desperation for an
instant and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those
massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard

it was sometime before they left the prison oliver nearly swooned
after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an hour or more
he had not the strength to walk

day was dawning when they again emerged a great multitude had already
assembled the windows were filled with people smoking and playing
cards to beguile the time the crowd were pushing quarrelling joking
everything told of life and animation but one dark cluster of objects
in the centre of all the black stage the crossbeam the rope and all
the hideous apparatus of death




chapter liii
and last


the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed
the little that remains to their historian to relate is told in few
and simple words

before three months had passed rose fleming and harry may lie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergyman s labour son the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home

mrs may lie took up her abode with her son and daughter in law to
enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her days the greatest felicity
that age and worth can know the contemplation of the happiness of those
on whom the warmest affections and tenderest care sofa well spent
life have been unceasingly bestowed

it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered
either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided
between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than
three thousand pounds by the provisions of his fathers will oliver
would have been entitled to the whole but mrbrown low unwilling to
deprive the elders on of the opportunity of retrieving his form ervices
and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to
which his young charge joyfully acceded

monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a
distant part of the new world where having quickly squandered i the
once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing along
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk
under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison as far from
home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagin s gang

mrbrown low adopted oliver as his son removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage house where his dear
friends resided he gratified the only remaining wish of oliver swarm
and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world

soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned
to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would
have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a
feeling and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how for
two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared
the air began to disagree with him then finding that the place really
no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his
assistant took a bachelors cottage outside the village of which his
young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered here he took to
gardening planting fishing carpenter ing and various other pursuits
of a similar kind all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity
in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood
as a most profound authority

before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for
mr grim wig which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated he
is accordingly visited by mr grim wig a great many times in the course
of the year on all such occasions mr grim wig plants fishes and
carpenters with great ardour doing everything in a very singular and
unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite
ass ever ation that his mode is the right one on sunday she never
fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman s face always
informing mr los berne in strict confidence afterwards that he
considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say
so it is a standing and very favourite joke for mrbrown low to rally
him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of the
night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his
return but mr grim wig contends that he was right in the main and in
proof there of remarks that oliver did not comeback after all which
always calls forth a laugh on his side and increases his good humour

mr noah clay pole receiving a free pardon from the crown in
consequence of being admitted approver against fagin and considering
his profession not altogether as safe a one a she could wish was for
some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened
with too much work after some consideration he went into business as
an in former in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence his
plan is to walkout once a week during church time attended by
charlotte in respectable attire the lady faints away at the doors of
charitable publicans and the gentleman being accommodated with
three pennyworth of brandy to restore her laysan information next
day and pockets half the penalty sometimes mr clay pole faints
himself but the result is the same

mr and mrs bumble deprived of their situations were gradually
reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in
that very same workhouse in which they had once lord edit over others
mr bumble has been heard to say that in this reverse and degradation
he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his
wife

as to mr giles and brittle s they still remain in their old posts
although the former is bald and the last named boy quite grey they
sleep at the parsonage but divide their attentions so equally among
its inmates and oliver and mrbrown low and mr los berne that to
this day the villagers have never be enable to discover to which
establishment they properly belong

master charles bates appalled by sikes s crime fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best
arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back
upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of
action he struggled hard and suffered much for sometime but
having a contented disposition and a good purpose succeeded in the
end and from being a farmers drudge and a carriers lad he is now
the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire

and now the hand that traces these words falters as it approaches
the conclusion of its task and would weave for a little longer space
the thread of these adventures

i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long
moved and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it i would
show rose may lie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood
shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light that fell
on all who trod it with her and shone into their hearts i would paint
her the life and joy of the fireside circle and the lively summer
group i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon and hear
the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk i would
watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling
untiring discharge of domestic duties at home i would paint her and
her dead sisters child happy in their love for one another and
passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so
sadly lost i would summon before me once again those joyous little
faces that clustered round her knee and listen to their merry prattle
i would recall the tones of that clear laugh and conjure up the
sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blueeye these and a
thousand looks and smiles and turns of thought and speech i would fain
recall them everyone

how mrbrown low went on from day today filling the mind of his
adopted child with stores of knowledge and becoming attached to him
more and more as his nature developed itself and showed the thriving
seeds of all he wished him to become how he traced in him new traits of
his early friend that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances
melancholy and yet sweet and soothing how the two orphans tried by
adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love
and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved them these
are all matters which need not to be told i have said that they were
truly happy and without strong affection and humanity of heart and
gratitude to that being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute
is benevolence to all things that breathe happiness can never be
attained

within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble
tablet which bears as yet but one word agnes there is no coffin in
that tomb and may it be many many years before another name is
placed above it but if the spirits of the dead ever comeback to
earth to visit spots hallowed by the love the love beyond the grave of
those whom they knew in life i believe that the shade of agnes
sometimes hovers round that solemn nook i believe it nonetheless
because that nook is in a church and she was weak and erring
